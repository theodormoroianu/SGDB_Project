1,I bought this hair oil after viewing so many good comments. But this product is not good enough.First of all its Expensive...Second thing the amount of the product is low (half bottle) YES!The bottle is not completely filled with oil. If you cheating on your customers #Mamaearth trust me on this you cant fool people more than once. Now I know that your Brand is not good enough. I am not going to buy any product from your Brand again.Thumbs down for mamaearth onion oil !!
5,"Used This Mama Earth Newly Launched Onion Oil twice, and i must say im already impressed by the results !It prevents hair loss, helps control premature greying, dryness, dandruff, scalp eruptions and many other hair problems after its regular use !To avoid dry and frizzy hair, make sure that you use this oil to your hairs twice a week.Oiling provides your scalp with essential nutrients, and also strengthens the hair roots. Mamaearth onion oil works best for your hair during all the seasons."
1,So bad product...My hair falling increase too much..I order shampoo mask and oil.. nothing stop hairfallAfter 3 to 4 wash my hair falling so badly...
1,Product just smells similar to navarathna hair oil .. but not strong as that and oil is not sticky after applying three drops of oil !! More review after usage of 2 months1) worst product2) hair fall increased a lot3) brought this product after watching YouTube influencer Mumbaiker Nikhil4) totally misguided never take suggestions from influencers.5) using since 2 months no result and Im losing my more hair6) mama earth just wasted my money as well damaged my hair7)better they provide solution or return my money
5,I have been trying different onion oil for my hair as my hair is not very healthy. This product has literally changed the texture of my scalp and I am really happy with the results. It comes in a nice colorful packaging too. Definitely recommend this one to everyone looking out for onion oil.  For more reviews you can follow me on Instagram @insi_lovemyself.
4,"I have been using this product for some time now. My Roommate had this and I had been planning to order for a while now. I just used to forget all the time, finally I have it now.Well from the last 2 months of use, heres my experience with the product:I use it every night and get a shower in the morning.Pros:1. The oil is non greasy, and pretty light.2. Has very good smell.no pungent or awkward fragrance3. My hair doesnt lump in together as with other hair oil products.4.Gives a pretty good shine and dark color5. Its very helpful for dandruff, hairfall/ hairloss. I dont have a very dense hair presence so my scalp was visible all the time, Now it looks pretty dense.Cons.1 .cant find anything at allI do recommend it for people having hairfall issues."
1,I purchased both oil and shampoo after watching fake YouTube  and customer review.After first day of use of oil and shampoo my hairfall increased.
5,Its a very good product from mamaearth. The oil gives your hair full strength and perfect shine. Onion are rich in sulphur thats add up the strength of hair roots and holds the hair preventing hairloss. Suitable for all type hair. For better result use at night. Go for it.
3,"Why are you showing onion oil benefits in your ad , when you ate not giving onion oil in your product. I bought this for redensyl content ...but not sure about the percentage of it bein added. Secondly it only has onion extracts, which am sure not is effective.Switchin back to my conventional method of makin onion juice and applyin on scalp"
5,I used it only one time so I cant say about hairfall control but I couldnt stop myself to mention about its amazing effect. It made my hair extremely soft and shiny which was visible properly. Smell was strong but not bothering. I think this is the best hair fall which I have used till date. My search ends over here I suppose. Just waiting to see its impact on arresting hairfall.

5,Nice one... My 2.5 yr old son likes to brush with this flavour- strawberry. Previously I used to use Chicco but switched to this one due to good reviews and lower price.I had used Mee Mee also but this ones ingredients are better for my childs health.
1,"My 2 year old child doesnt have cavity but started developing bad breaths the morning after, while using this toothpaste for a couple of weeks during day and night brushing sessions. I feel this toothpaste might actually cause cavity rather than keep it away, from my experience. I immediately shifted back to Pigeon toothpaste for night brushing and the bad breath stopped from the next day onward.  I had purchased it for its all natural properties. Mama Earth team needs to research more on the ingredients on this product. I use other Mama Earth products and they are decent. Not this toothpaste though."
5,"Berry flavoured blast that the kids just love!  And the best part is that its perfectly fine if  they swallow it too! Made with 100% safe ingredients, this should be the toothpaste you should introduce your kids to! Mamaearth Berry Blast toothpaste is 100% safe and toxin free. My kids love the Berry taste while brushing. This is one of the best flouride free tooth pastes available for kids that you should be buying right away!"
5,Well how much a 12 month old with 4 almost 5 teeth brushes. But this product is good to start eating or tasting rather by baby. that way it is natural and taste good. i applied bit on her teeth thn forgot where i kept it.Buy for your own satisfaction if baby is really small and if understands how to brush and spit or eat than go for it.
5,"Pros:1. Natural strawberry flavour.2. SLS  Fluoride free toothpaste.3. 100% vegan.4. Claims to be plastic responsible.Cons:None that I found in the last few months.Verdict:Recommended toothpaste for kids above 1 year. My son likes it. The strawberry flavour is quite noticeable when youre brushing your kid. Wish if this was available as single pack instead of minimum qty as 2 since it takes quite a lot of time to finish the tube when you are taking only a peanut size or less portion for brushingIf you think my review was helpful, dont forget to click the helpful link below the review."
5,Very good product. Reliable and very good quality. My child (4YO) loves it. Earlier he was using Chicco toothpaste. Now loving it. Mamaearth is at par with Chicco in quality yet way economical.
4,"I bought it for my 2 years baby. Its mentioned that even if the child gulps it, then also it wont be harmful. Although I am trying my best to teach my little one how to spit out while brushing.I am happy with the product."
5,"The important aspect i considered while placing the order was""its safe, even if swallowed"".Small kids love to brush with it.Its the tooth paste with all safe ingredients."
5,The taste is a bit like mild flavoured bubble gum.... My 2 yr old likes it. Plus it claims to be safe for kids since it is all natural without flouride and SLS (chemical used for foaming).Wish that the quantity was a bit more
5,It is completely natural so I feel safe for my son. Before I used dento shine tooth paste. But this has changed a lott. Just go for it . It safe.

5,I bought this because I was super impressed with the ingredients list. This one says its a skin-lighting face wash which I felt so disappointed about at first but then I realised it makes your skin lighter by removing tan from your face. I am really very impressed with the effects. It leaves my skin squeaky clean and makes it brighter. I really love the fragrance of this face wash.
1,Its thick.It has beads and I dont know why they want me to scrub my face off everyday !!!It doesnt foam like a facewash.It smells like pulpy orange while applying and then smells a bit like turmeric after washing off.My face looked bright after using it but not as bright as my previous facewashes.Made my skin dry. It was annoying since my skin was already dry without it and it made it worse !It is definitely not worth the money ( I got it for 175rs in a sale.  Still isnt worth it )I dont think it worked on my tan. I still dont see any changes in skin.Its disappointing !!!!
5,"So this is one such facewash free from parabens and sulfate, hence made me order it. Talking about the natural ingredients like turmeric and liquorice extract attracted it more. The consistency of this facewash is bit thick like a scrub making it unusual for others but I loved it as it makes your skin clean and radiant. Best for people who wants to get rid of tanning, discoloration and pigmentation."
5," It has a pleasant smell. You dont need to apply in large quantity. Even though it has walnut beads, but its not like an intense scrubber, you can use daily. Apply some face moisturizer after this. Consistency is not liquidy. (see the image). KEY INGREDIENTS:∙ Stearic Acid:It has cleansing properties. It helps to remove dirt, sweat and excess sebum from the skin.∙ Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate:It produces a natural creamy-feeling lather.

I hope this review and images were helpful. "
5,"Had tried this product majorly because of the name and ingredients that it has. For the first time a company is able to get the product that is based on our ancient secret recipes of our Dadi Nani... a person like me who has super dry skin, this is the perfect product for me as it hydrates my skin thoroughly and gives an instant freshness like the way ubtan gives. Very good for my super dry  super sensitive skin. Loved this product. Kudos mamaearth for this amazing thought behind this product ."
1,"After reading so many great reviews, was eagerly waiting for this face wash but when I opened it the tube was half empty...very disappointed."

5,Ubtan Facewash- made from Turmeric and Liqurice Extract. Was excited to use as heard first time about facewash of Ubtan. Helps in removing dead cells and gives a glow on skin. Very helpful product to repair sun damage and tan and to protect your skin from tanning.

5,"Had tried this product majorly because of the name and ingredients that it has. For the first time a company is able to get the product that is based on our ancient secret recipes of our Dadi Nani... a person like me who has super dry skin, this is the perfect product for me as it hydrates my skin thoroughly and gives an instant freshness like the way ubtan gives. Very good for my super dry  super sensitive skin. Loved this product. Kudos mamaearth for this amazing thought behind this product ."
1,"After reading so many great reviews, was eagerly waiting for this face wash but when I opened it the tube was half empty...very disappointed."

5,Ubtan Facewash- made from Turmeric and Liqurice Extract. Was excited to use as heard first time about facewash of Ubtan. Helps in removing dead cells and gives a glow on skin. Very helpful product to repair sun damage and tan and to protect your skin from tanning.
1,Horrible product...i have normal skin which tends to dry in winters...i ordered it in march when i enjoy healthier skin...but i was in search of herbal product and decided to order this...and i regret...my skin has rashes and that happens only after 3daz of use....i could infer that the rashes were becoz of this facewash as all other skincare products were same....for all who are reading this review...plz dont waste ur money....and get trapped by the marketing gimmick
5,"Mamaearth ubTAN Natural Face Wash is one the best product of Mama Earthand it  Suits to every  skin types, it  helps in removing  all signs of tan. Liquorice helps repair the sun damage caused by exposure to the harsh rays of the sun. Turmeric light the skin tone and  improves the skin complection.Its one of the best face wash. Smells also very nice."
5,I bought this because I was super impressed with the ingredients list. This one says its a skin-lighting face wash which I felt so disappointed about at first but then I realised it makes your skin lighter by removing tan from your face. I am really very impressed with the effects. It leaves my skin squeaky clean and makes it brighter. I really love the fragrance of this face wash.
1,Its thick.It has beads and I dont know why they want me to scrub my face off everyday !!!It doesnt foam like a facewash.It smells like pulpy orange while applying and then smells a bit like turmeric after washing off.My face looked bright after using it but not as bright as my previous facewashes.Made my skin dry. It was annoying since my skin was already dry without it and it made it worse !It is definitely not worth the money ( I got it for 175rs in a sale.  Still isnt worth it )I dont think it worked on my tan. I still dont see any changes in skin.Its disappointing !!!!
5,"So this is one such facewash free from parabens and sulfate, hence made me order it. Talking about the natural ingredients like turmeric and liquorice extract attracted it more. The consistency of this facewash is bit thick like a scrub making it unusual for others but I loved it as it makes your skin clean and radiant. Best for people who wants to get rid of tanning, discoloration and pigmentation."
5," It has a pleasant smell. You dont need to apply in large quantity. Even though it has walnut beads, but its not like an intense scrubber, you can use daily. Apply some face moisturizer after this. Consistency is not liquidy. (see the image). KEY INGREDIENTS:∙ Stearic Acid:It has cleansing properties.

3,"Frankly I have ordered this product after seeing so many good reviews..and here is my honest review after using for about 15 days--Does not break my skin- feel light and mositurized- does nothing for my marks or uneven toneSo, the purpose of fading marks or making glowing skin is not at all entertained so far.Yet I want to wait till 1 bottle use. Can be used as light mositurising serum for upcoming summers. Hopes it helps!"
5,"Mamaearths face serum its just very amazing. I have tried so many products for my face pigmentation problem but this product is superb. Due to this product my pigmentation problem is resolved plus my skin qulaity is improved. It comes with vitamin C which is very essential for healthy skin. So happy to come across this product , superb happy with my glowing skin. I sure trying this product one wont switch to another."
4,"Fast absorbing  non-greasy Face Serum, Turmeric properties works well for radiant skin and Vitamin C antioxidant properties supporting it very well with reducing acne/dark spots. Using it from the last 15 days and so far its really working well for me, Cant say about actual result so soon need to wait at least 15-20 days more to check actual results on Face Brightens and Fine Lines Reduction."
5,I ordered this serum on the recommendation of my very dear friend. The serum comes in a small pump type packaging. After a week of use i can tell that the procuct is effective. The serum keeps the skin hydrated and blooming. The serum provides radiance to the skin thus compatible with every skin tone. It doesnt make your face fairer but it definitely provides glow to the skin. The product is worth a try.
1,"Um the product is really not for people with sensitive skin. I read good reviews on Amazon and ordered it (I was using vitamin c products from other brands which are really expensive so I thought I could give this a try since this is very affordable). But within a week of use I started breaking out all over my face, the big zits kind. I had to stop using within a week of its use. May be the product works for non-sensitive skin, product is really light, can’t tell if it gives any kind of moisture to the skin. I had to change my entire skin care routine, bought my tried and tested organic products and my skin is much much better. I don’t trust mamaearth any more."
1,It may not suit everyone may be. I had high expectations from this..my skin isnt acne prone and I had smooth skin before I used it. I just started using it just for the sake of extra glow but it turned out opposite for me. I used it 3 days n now stopped as I got small white acne on forehead n on nose u can check the picture. N what Im worried about it I got a small white patch under my eyes the 3rd day. M horrified n wont use it and dont recommend this to everyone. I wasted my 500 bucks!!
2,I was really hoping that this serum will be as good as the mcaffeine face serum.....But after using 1whole bottle of it.....I really cant see any visible changes on my skin.....It didnt reduced my pigmentation....And it is really very liquidy in consistency that it dries out my skin.....I have to apply a moisturizer after using this serum. Well it didnt worked for me at all.....Wasted 😢
1,Waste of money. Do not buy . No results.
5,Just go for it. Before I started using it I had spots on my face from breakouts and uneven skintone its been around 15 days since I started using it and I have noticed spots are lighter than before and I can see my skintone getting even than before. Its easily observe in the skin within a minute.The only downside is its smell but its not pungent or discomforting one.
1,"I bought it for my mom as she was having problems related to her skin like hyperpigmentation. Being in her 50s she has a well managed diet plan and routine. The package delivered was suitable and fine look wise. But, after applying on face for a week, her forehead started to develop rashes accompanied by itchiness. She had to literally stop it and wait till it heals which took  more than two weeks. Personally I would not recommend this product to any of the ladies out there. Its just a waste of money and time. And ofcourse, I wont get a refund or payback. I am surely disappointed, dissatisfied, and annoyed."

4,I have oily acne prone skin and have been using this product for a few days now. My acne has dried out but I do not see a significant improvement in dark spots yet. The fragrance is mild so brilliant! Ill continue using this as it helped my acne. Just a tip to all people with acne skin. Keep your scalp clean and change your pillow sheets. It really helps.
2,I have been using this product for 1yr.but the product i received have a diffrent smell and consistency...i doubt it is the original product..!!and it is only 30ml...the usual is 50ml
5,My most fav go to cream for blemishes. Nothing was helping me.much to get rid of my blemishes and I started using it ...I felt the difference very quickly but after sometime I thought it stopped working so I stopped using but I realized it was working only when I stopped using it. It made a huge difference . M not stopping it now.
5,"I have hyperpigmentation , have been using this cream since 1 week , my hyperpigmentation has bee reduce to an extent . Will update you in few months "
1,Here is an honest review... please think twice before buying this product... instead of removing pimples...there was pimples all over my face
5,"Mamaearth products are made of 100%  natural ingredients which contain mulberry extract and vitamin C.MulBerry extract is used to treat hyperpigmentation and vitamin C heals in sun damage and repairs damaged skin cells.It suits all skin types .It is free from mineral oil and paraben.It reduces dark spots,blemishes and controls melanin.It has  a pump dispenser which is great for travelling. Can be used as a moisturiser."
2,"Hello everyone, Please buy this product only if you are looking for ""Moisturizer"" .This works as a great moisturizer and it does the job what it claims for but not 100%.Iam writing this review after 1 month of usage and realised that this is a product where 30ml  isnt available in original website of ""Mamaearth , I  figured out only after purchasing 50 ml from original website of Mamaearth.Ingredients: If you compare the ingredients of 30ml and 50ml : 30ml contains all the chemicals and 50ml consists of all the essential oils which is great.Scent: 30ml bottle has great smell coz all the chemicals are added.50ml bottle has the smell of essential oils which most of them might not like it( Hardly any chemical is added)This I figured out after using the 30ml which I purchased from Amazon and I used it exactly for 1 month and bottle got over, then I was looking to buy another one and I went to Mamaearth original site and figured out this .I would recommend you to compare the ingredients before you buy this from Amazon"
1,The ingredients list in 30ml bottle are completely different from 50ml bottle.. more chemicals present in 30ml pack. The cream smells like antiseptic/chemical cream. In 50ml cream u ll find essential oils in the ingredients list but in 30ml you will find chemicals list.. totally its waste of money.
2,So I am a big fan of MAMA EARTH products and I generally places order from Nykaa. This time thought of giving a try to Amazon. But I am highly disappointed by the product. It seems like a copied product of the original mama earth. The scent is bad and this cream broke me out badly. It is not like the original product. You dont expect this from a product which is on a pricier side.
5,Guys I cant believe it this really work on my face its like magic for me I love this memaearth bye bye one you can see be4 n after pic so much difference I brought this on 27 feb 2020 now its 23march with in a month my face spots have lighten up n face became fair n dark spots r less I love this memaearth plz go n try this value for money

5,I am writing this review after using it around 20 days. It seems very natural and chemical free and is very gentle on skin. But it does its job of cleaning the skin properly. It contains tea tree which is one of my favourite ingredients for skin care. Give it a try... its definitely better than all other chemicals containing face washes.And its even affordable as compared to other natural brands available in market.
5,Though it is pricey but quality comes at a price. It is free of chemicals so a healthy option for skin. Gives results on acne prone face in 7-8 days. Cleanses face very well and quantity required is also less. This will b my face wash for years to come.
5,"This face wash is amazing guys. Ive oily skin. Every now and then my face breaks out. But when I first time used this within 4 wash my pimples were gone! Im not jocking guys. This face wash does wonders. I use it two times daily, after waking up in the morning and before going to bed. Now Im using it for two months. And I dont  a single pimple past two months. For every oily skin acne prone beauties Ill recommend this facewash."
4,"I have oily to combination skin. During Monsoons, my skin becomes even oilier due to humidity and also it becomes more prone to breakouts. I have been using this face wash for quite some time now and it works amazing on my skin. It extracts the excess oil from my skin and leaves it clean but not dehydrated. Also, I havent faced any breakout on my face since Ive started using it."
1,Caused too much pimples on dry and sensitive skin. Would recommend VLCC for such skin type as it doesnt atleast have any side effects. Very disappointed by Mamaearth. Had a hell a lot of expectations.
4,I really love services of amazon their delivery their return policy their  packing.Their service towards their customers its applicable.Now product- 3.5 star  Average plus product. odour of the material i didnt like. It smells like medicated facewash. I dont know whether it fights with acne or pimple. I wasnt having any pimple or acne issues but only for concern i switched to herbal facewash and first i picked aroma magic tea tree oil face which was good i applied it on my face for several months but suddenly some acne and pimple attack on my face i didnt know the cause and then i switched to mamaearth face wash but it did nothing on my face used it for 15 days no result i got. Both the product were fail to cure my pimple or acneI dont know what kind of pimple attack it was. only two or three pimple used to occur after healing that again two or three. OMG finally i consulted to doctor.Both the product i purchased with recommandation of fit tuber on YouTube.If your face is free of pimples or acne then you can use these products by replacing chemical products. But if youre suffering from pimples or acne i dont know both the facewashes will work or not. Because everybody has their own skin and their own causes of occuring pimples or acnes.You can buy and try.
1,I have acne prone oily skin.. thought this product will help reducing them and also stop further breakouts.. I am reviewing after 1month of use.. this product is of no use.
5,"I love Mamaearth products and have been using them since six months now. Was looking for a facewash for acne for my mom when I stumbled across Mamaearths new range of face washes. All the products are chemical free and this one is really gentle on the skin. This comes in an easy squeezy tube. The facewash is clear like a gel and have tea tree fragrance. it really helps fighting acne and in almost two uses, my mother was really impressed. A must buy for anyone fighting acne."
1,"I m editing this review on 11/5/2020, my experience with this product is so disappointing.its quality is lower than regular soap , for any skin type I dont recommend to buy this, not worth for money, it just clean your face with water thats all it do, its a scam, I bought this product after watching fit YouTubber channel, and I wasted my money; I say dont go after product that says its natural its a big scam , not only they dont work on you but they come very very expensive , I use home remedies and some regular Market product."
5,"I have sensitive and acne prone skin. More than active acne i have scars on my face. This face wash shows visible results after 1 usage only. It is very gentle on skin, has a pleasant and mild fragrance. Does not rip off the natural oil from your face, leaves your face deeply cleansed and smooth after wash. It is complete value for money"

I have been using this face wash for quite some time now and it works amazing on my skin. It extracts the excess oil from my skin and leaves it clean but not dehydrated. Also, I havent faced any breakout on my face since Ive started using it."
1,Caused too much pimples on dry and sensitive skin. Would recommend VLCC for such skin type as it doesnt atleast have any side effects. Very disappointed by Mamaearth. Had a hell a lot of expectations.
4,I really love services of amazon their delivery their return policy their  packing.Their service towards their customers its applicable.Now product- 3.5 star  Average plus product. odour of the material i didnt like. It smells like medicated facewash. I dont know whether it fights with acne or pimple. I wasnt having any pimple or acne issues but only for concern i switched to herbal facewash and first i picked aroma magic tea tree oil face which was good i applied it on my face for several months but suddenly some acne and pimple attack on my face i didnt know the cause and then i switched to mamaearth face wash but it did nothing on my face used it for 15 days no result i got. Both the product were fail to cure my pimple or acneI dont know what kind of pimple attack it was. only two or three pimple used to occur after healing that again two or three. OMG finally i consulted to doctor.Both the product i purchased with recommandation of fit tuber on YouTube.If your face is free of pimples or acne then you can use these products by replacing chemical products. But if youre suffering from pimples or acne i dont know both the facewashes will work or not. Because everybody has their own skin and their own causes of occuring pimples or acnes.You can buy and try.
1,I have acne prone oily skin.. thought this product will help reducing them and also stop further breakouts.. I am reviewing after 1month of use.. this product is of no use.
5,"I love Mamaearth products and have been using them since six months now. Was looking for a facewash for acne for my mom when I stumbled across Mamaearths new range of face washes. All the products are chemical free and this one is really gentle on the skin. This comes in an easy squeezy tube. The facewash is clear like a gel and have tea tree fragrance. it really helps fighting acne and in almost two uses, my mother was really impressed. A must buy for anyone fighting acne."
1,"I m editing this review on 11/5/2020, my experience with this product is so disappointing.its quality is lower than regular soap , for any skin type I dont recommend to buy this, not worth for money, it just clean your face with water thats all it do, its a scam, I bought this product after watching fit YouTubber channel, and I wasted my money; I say dont go after product that says its natural its a big scam , not only they dont work on you but they come very very expensive , I use home remedies and some regular Market product."
5,"I have sensitive and acne prone skin. More than active acne i have scars on my face. This face wash shows visible results after 1 usage only. It is very gentle on skin, has a pleasant and mild fragrance. Does not rip off the natural oil from your face, leaves your face deeply cleansed and smooth after wash. It is complete value for money"
5,I am writing this review after using it around 20 days. It seems very natural and chemical free and is very gentle on skin. But it does its job of cleaning the skin properly. It contains tea tree which is one of my favourite ingredients for skin care. Give it a try... its definitely better than all other chemicals containing face washes.And its even affordable as compared to other natural brands available in market.
5,Though it is pricey but quality comes at a price. It is free of chemicals so a healthy option for skin. Gives results on acne prone face in 7-8 days. Cleanses face very well and quantity required is also less. This will b my face wash for years to come.
5,"This face wash is amazing guys. Ive oily skin. Every now and then my face breaks out. But when I first time used this within 4 wash my pimples were gone! Im not jocking guys. This face wash does wonders. I use it two times daily, after waking up in the morning and before going to bed. Now Im using it for two months. And I dont  a single pimple past two months. For every oily skin acne prone beauties Ill recommend this facewash."

5,"Mamaearth is always best.  Every product of this brand is awesome.  I love all babies products by Mamaearth. Best part of this soap is SUITABLE FOR EVERY BABYS DELICATE SKIN even you can try it for your newborns as well.  Im using it for my baby since birth. Quality same as mentioned. The natural nutrients present in goat milk gets easily absorbed in the delicate skin of your baby and keeps it moisturized for long time.SUITS DRY, ITCHY, ECZEMA PRONE SKIN as well.  Best product. You can purchase it for your baby or for gifting for your loved ones."
1,Update: horrible bathing that I have used so far... My 3 year old son developed hives after using the soap and more over it turned him dark... Fragrance too strong... It literally hits you.. Will never buy again...The bar is ok ok... Not so good as it claims.... I used on my kid and feel it doesnt cleanse well.  I have a dry skin... I used for myself on face and found that my skin is still dry after washing... So nothing great about the moisturising part and more over I dont feel fresh after washing my face with this bar... Its like I havent washed my face.  So I really doubt if it cleanses ur skin.
3,"Although, it makes a very rich and creamy lather, it starts melting quickly if kept wet. I need to take it out of the bathroom and dry it for the next use as I want to save as much of it as possible because its costlier than other brands. But, it does a far better job than other brands and its organic. Im happy to have this soap in my skincare regimen as an adult who has a very sensitive skin prone to irritation. The best thing about this soap is it doesnt leave any residue, which Im surprised to see. Other brands leave a thin film which makes skin feel very slippery and smooth and I dont like that. I want my skin to feel naked, fresh and not stripped with moisture. Mamaearth soap as well as the mamaearth baby wash did an excellent job. :)"
1,"Very bad product worth ZERO star. The entire soap turn into a pasty mass after one time use. Not worth buying this product as the second day onwards one has to scoop it with hand like a cream and apply on baby. Bad manufacturing process for this soap. Better they market it in the form of liquid body wash. Moreover, the soapy feel doesnt go from the body on few rinse. Worst than Teddy bar which has similar outcome, but better than this. Dermadew found to best on my trials to find a good soap for my baby."
1,I avoided the previous negative reviews for this item and trusted mama earth brand but Im sharing this review after 2 weeks of use. On 1st day itself I got rashes on my skin but I ignored it. Later on my whole face got rashes and small boils. My skin became too dry and spotty. I used it with mama earth baby cream still my skin was drying out giving me many burns on face. I stopped using this item and continued my cetaphil cleansing lotion. I will never use mama earths any product again. I threw away the soaps and moisturizer.
5,"I really have started appreciating this brand as the product they made really works well and best part is they are made from safe ingredients. This baby soap is been enriched with goodness  goat milk, oatmeal, Shea butter and coconut based cleanser. The skin of my toddler feels so soft after bath. The shape of the soap is perfect for little one to hold as well. No tears formula of soap is working great. It is very gentle on the skin. The fragrance is so amazing. I highly recommend this moisturizing bath to all mommies and daddies. I specially recommend it for toddlers who are in phase where they want to be independent and bath by themselves."
4,Everytime I used to search baby soap when one going to finish.this time I heard about mamaearth baby soap.lets try but its been a week i am using it for my daughter.now I think my search now going to be ended.it is very mild which is good for baby skin
5,"A gentle cleansing soap that doesnt dry out skin and leaves a lingering baby fragrance after use. Yet another fabulous stellar product by Mamaearth,  makes a  perfect gift for a baby hamper too."
5,"The soap is really good and I really appreciate its quality. It leaves babys skin soft, moisturized and doesnt dry it out at all. However, only after 2 days of use, the soap became a lump of cream and I literally have to keep it in a bowl and scoop out little at a time, like cream to use it. Mamaearth please do something about it without compromising on the quality."
5,The soap is creamy and less foamy which means it is sulfate free and has fresh coconut fragrance . You will feel the difference in your babys skin the day you start using it. The packaging is Excellent!!! I give it more than five starts

4,Great productBut one thing I want to ask Amazon  being a Global Chain Market why they are using cheap plastic for packaging ?As they are Global the should focus on Bio -degradable plastic for packaging please mail me about this .Thank you
5,"the quality that godrej is delivering is top notch. I previously used lifebuoy, dettol, santoor even patanjali also. but this product is something different. the smell is very good and the clear gel is also very gentle to the hands"
5,"Very nice hand wash. I have used most of the brands available in the market and by far this is the best. Its so mild on your hands and does its job of cleaning well. This is the first time I have used the master blaster, I have been a big fan of their masterchefs hand wash ( different variant )."
3,The scent and feel of the hand wash seems different from earlier ones as I have been using this brand purechased from  Amazon dealers only since last six months. My impression after first use was it being inferior or not genuine product. As it came from Cloudtrail I do not doubt it but still there is something wrong with this supply.
2,The fragrance that is left behind using the green color product makes you feel in heaven while this wants to run to hell and stay there. This product needs a better smell for this particular blue liquid handwash. I feel like I am in a hospital every time I wash my hands with it.
5,"Firstly thanks to Amazon for ""Delivering Essential Items"" during the lockdown in ""Red Zones"" as it is impossible to think of online product deliveries  in the current situation.No issues with the product "
4,This handwash gives a mild scent and very good on pocket. A little liquid spreads well and lathers up well to clean hands efficiently. The reduced MRP makes it more affordable and an added gain. One of the first products in our most essential lists.
4,"I always used Dettol handwash, pink one, thats always better for me.But after using this, I personally feel that it is soften than Dettol handwash.Smell is also better, and foam development is better than Dettol."
5,Purchased 2 packs of 750ml each but surprised to see 1 full pack of 750ml filled into my pump dispenser of 650 ml capacity. To be noted my dispenser is an empty bottle of pantene shampoo having standard capacity. Sure about less volume of hand waah. One pack is still intact with its seal. You may check it any time within a month.
4,Was using other brands for hand wash bt after using Godrej Protekt our own country product Im fully satisfied n happy . Fragrance is superb n ofcourse value for money product.Will definitely recommend.

5,"Godrej No. 1 is one of those soaps that has been able to balance all the essential tick points in a common bath soap viz pleasant fragrance, good lather, soft on the skin (I use this during Delhi winters and while some soaps leads to skin drying, Godrej No. 1 leaves the skin soft and moisturized) and economical.I personally love the Lime fragrance but all the other ones are good too and it boils down to an individual preference. Irrespective of the fragrance it will not disappoint. Highly recommend.If you find this review useful then please press the ""Helpful"" button. Thanks."

4,Good soap with nice fragrance
4,Godrej No.1 Sandal Turmeric soaps are extremely value for money as they do not dissolve easily in water resulting in greater longevity.Sandal fragrance is subtle and keeps you fresh after bath.Package includes 4 soaps each of 150gm.Thanks to Amazon Pantry for safe and timely delivery.
5,Its a very good soap which gives sufficient lather and cleans the body. Also leaves a very good fragrance.
5,"I really dont give out 5 stars lightly. But I LOVE this soap. It smells great. It lasts longer than others sandalwood soaps Ive tried. It lathers very well, rinses away well. And the fragrance lasts for a little while afterwards. No drying, sticky residue. Does the job well done ✅. And the amount of bars for the price is an added bonus. I have tried the other well known brand and I like this better."
3,Item is ok. Costlier (Rs 76 ) than MRP Price.
4,Itz lyk mysore Sandal.. But mysore Sandal comes only 10 to 13 days for my kids to bath.. But this soap come one month for the same usage.. Value for money
2,"Havnt expected such a low standard soap from Godrej, the scent is just for the first time as if it is applied on top of the soap, longevity also less, the soap vanishes in less than a week for two people and two times a day"
2,The soap doesnt feels good to me. Appears a bit hard. Although price wise its cheap but I personally didnt like it.
1,"I was mislead by the reviews. Overall, its a cheap soap. There are definitely better soaps of Sandal available in the market from different brands."

4,"My moms favorite brand is Godrej, and my wife choose this model, thats why I buy this one. Recently received the product from amazon. Delivery was good and the Delivery Boy never ask for any money really very good and professional. Before buy this I verify the price with local and also Godrej shops the price of this product is 21600 rupee but in amazon I get this in 16k. So my suggestion never buy the product from local shops if you do that then you also pay the extra money for toli vara and delivery charges might be they can give you some extra ice tray but still amazon is best. Here some pros and cons I providePros : Beautyfull Colorfull look, direct cool,  large vegetables rack. Absolute zero noise.Cons: backside is open can not remove the water store for clean the water,Only one ice tray so Ice lover feel sad.I had recently get this one so for now this was my review I will again post another review after use of a month. Till then stay tune to searching and reading reviews."
1,"Amazon after sales service is PATHETIC, PRODUCT IS DEFECTIVE AND THEY WONT DO REFUND.Refrigerator is making noiseDoor wont shut properlyBack panel coils will be hot, danger for childrenAmazon started selling defective low grade products.i asked for refund they denied, they technician wil come and repair it ( repairing newly bought product)Note: There is nothing like Prime members, even prime members will not get any resolution.HOPELESS AFTER SALES IF PRODUCT IS NOT GOOD..DONT BUY!!!Going to escalate in corp email, lets see what happens!!!***Update**** TataCLIQ has 7 days return policy on refrigerators, lets buy from Indian website, amazon is waste in after sales service."
4,"The product was delivered as promised. Just checked only.

4,"My moms favorite brand is Godrej, and my wife choose this model, thats why I buy this one. Recently received the product from amazon. Delivery was good and the Delivery Boy never ask for any money really very good and professional. Before buy this I verify the price with local and also Godrej shops the price of this product is 21600 rupee but in amazon I get this in 16k. So my suggestion never buy the product from local shops if you do that then you also pay the extra money for toli vara and delivery charges might be they can give you some extra ice tray but still amazon is best. Here some pros and cons I providePros : Beautyfull Colorfull look, direct cool,  large vegetables rack. Absolute zero noise.Cons: backside is open can not remove the water store for clean the water,Only one ice tray so Ice lover feel sad.I had recently get this one so for now this was my review I will again post another review after use of a month. Till then stay tune to searching and reading reviews."

4,"Ive been using this Godrej aer pocket for a couple of years now. Yes I understand that the fragrance doesnt last for more than a week. It is very strong the first couple of days and rest of the times it is just a light hint of the scent. Then the gel eventually crystallizes.I figured out a way for a juggad. Basically I never take the gel pack out of the plastic cover. There is a hole at the top to hang individual packs for store displays that I cut. Then with scissors, I carefully make 3 slender cuts. This makes the scent come out soft and not too powerful. It lasts for almost 20 days this way. The violet fragrance (purple) lasts for 25 days with this.Hope this review is helpful."
4,"These champs are better considering they are way to different from the Odonil fresheners we have been using for ages (its basic law of diminishing returns) Ill encourage you to try them for their fragrance, and they are apt for any room in your apartment. When newly opened the fragrance is too strong that i would kick you in the face with it, but it dissolves when you give it a couple of days.Another good part about this is the concept of hanging it, I usually do in the fall ceiling of my washrooms, and it works pretty well.Word of caution: Dont expect it to last a month, because mine never have. Maximum 20 to 22 days, and then youll want to replace it with a new one, but if you grab it on a deal on Amazon Pantry, its quite economical"
5,"Used this product.fragrance is excellent and of my liking. Very effective for closed spaces including car, toilet, bathroom, offices etc. Easy to install so no zanzat. Fragrance lasts roughly fifteen days, but during this period it should please you and your guests."
1,"Seems duplicate product as the fragrance has faded after 5 days of use. Amazon authorities please do a check with supplier of this product,I think now I cannot return the item as I hv opened the packet,but how a buyer can be sure about the product without using the item??I think this can be a fit case to be filed with consumer forum.Buyers DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.SUNIL"
1,"On each box the MRP is mentioned as rs 160 , for pack of 3 packs it become rs480 but they are selling at rs495 for 3 boxes ,Kindly take a action against this"
5,I am overall happy with this product. But if you want to maintain freshness in your toilet area make sure you buy little more quantities of this product as it doesnt last very longer in my frank opinion. No complaints about fragrance. You would surely love it. So go check this out. Very Good product. It wouldnt disappoint you.
2,The smell did not last for a week also. It was strong on the first day. After that one couldnt make out the presence of this product at all.
5,I think one the best product I have used...It just freshens ur mood... Better than its odonil counterparts... The scent spreads evenly.. just go for it..
3,Some of the packet looks like they have leaked and it is wet all over when you open the seal.  The fragrance does not last for 30 days.  It starts off with very strong smell and within a week it just fades.
5,The misty had kind of a soapy smell but works. Smell is pleasant but hardly you would know about the smell unless you get close to it. The citrus has a sort of tangy smell but i find it better than the misty. Will have to try the violet. Initial days your room will be filled with the pleasant smell but a packet  lasts only for like 14 days. In the latter days you will completely forget about it. If you have the shell to spend then go for it.

1,"To start off, the safe arrived with a Low Battery message, meaning that before I could do anything else, I had to go and get new batteries for this brand new item. Once you get things in order, the safe works well and serves its purpose, however, the manual provided is obsolete, and the instructions do not match up with this product. There are no solutions posted online either. If you want to program the safe, you have to figure it out on your own. The customer service personnel were not helpful either and they kept trying to force me to get a technician to come to my house at the cost of Rs. 500 just to program the device, which completely defeats the purpose of online shopping. Dont fall for it. This is rather ridiculous for such a big brand like Godrej.In case anyone else needs to re-program their home code, here is what I was able to do. I hope it works for you too:1.) The instructions indicate to press 68#, but it actually means 68(Lock). If the instructions indicate *, try pressing Clear2.) Every time I pressed 68#, I got an error message, so I had to go through all the steps listed below.3.) Before you can change personal code in home mode, you will need to Access The Programming (pg. 6). The code is 751019 which means that there are 6 different features that you can program. Go through all the steps and change the numbers as they suit you. When you get to the last digit, there are no instructions written in the book, so you will have to figure this out on your own. If the last digit is 1, change it to 0 or 9.4.) After going through the programming and changing the last number, you should be able to go back to change the personal code in home mode.5.) If you set your password and it doesnt lock, go back to the programming again, and change the last digit back to what it was originally.Good luck."
1,Received damaged product. The case is scratched in multiple places and all the parts are loose. Looks like  a duplicate box with iron is painted and set up with godrej tag and sent to us. Highly dissatisfied with the product quality
4,"The product was good. But starting it for the first time took me several hours to start and install it properly.Here I will list out all steps so that reading this other people might find it helpful.1. Unwrap the package properly. Look for any damages.2. You will find a set of keys attached in a plastic sachet.3. Use the key to open the locker. There is a white cover near the button panel ,open it to insert keys.4. Inside the locker you will find the manual and wall mounting knots.5. The other side of the keypad panel will contain the battery space which needs 4 AA batteries for the led to start. But before inserting the batteries do see the positive  negative marked side and insert the batteries according to the charge respectively.6. Close the battery lid and led will automatically start working. The battery lid needs a small screw to get fixed. so if u dont find the screw in any plastic packets then use another aftermarket screws or maybe the screw is present inside the locker mechanism.7. The locker mechanism screws can be unlocked by a particular opener which will be given with the mounting knots inside the locker.8. The locker is now ready to use. Remove the keys and use the led to unlock and lock it. The default password is 1234.9. Please donot apply any pressure or try to press the firm bolts of the locker mechanism when the locker is open. Let the motor of the locker do its work.10. If the locker shows any other error message. Do consult the user manual.Note. Please be calm and do things properly or else you might damage the product."
5,"Easy to operate.But installation is a head breaking thing. After repeated calls to Godrej customer care, finally they came after 20 days and charged 750 rupees for installation. Good for small stuff. Light weight hence it needs to be mounted in cupboard or wall otherwise it is light enough to be carried and run ;-) Best thing is that I got it in a deal 4200."

3,The reason I declined the purchase was that it was to light.A thief can easily take it and open it in their own sweet time.Therefore I declined the purchase
5,Good product and provides good security. Provides a master pwd which can be used even if we forget regular pwd.Executive has provided DEMO on time after taking appointment by calling customer care. Charged 300/- for demo  installation.
5,"I love this digital safe locker. Now I can put all my important stuff inside this box. The good thing is that it is not that bulky. The material is also very good, seems very strong and heavy. And, It is very easy to install. I have not mounted/fixed it because I put this inside the almera. Now I can feel safer by keeping cash, passport and other valuable stuff.Lookwise also it just has a classy touch. It has a proper colored LED display. It works on the battery power and the consumption is very low. You can set your own passcode from the 4-8 digits. I like it beep sound whenever you have to press the keys. In addition it also has 2 emergency keys. Overall now I am very calm ever since this digital safe has been arrived. Of course now I can manage my things for my own peace of mind according to my needs :-).Earlier I never ever used such kind of digital safe but after have been started using  this I found this as exactly as what I expected for.

Unwrap the package properly. Look for any damages.2. You will find a set of keys attached in a plastic sachet.3. Use the key to open the locker. There is a white cover near the button panel ,open it to insert keys.4. Inside the locker you will find the manual and wall mounting knots.5. The other side of the keypad panel will contain the battery space which needs 4 AA batteries for the led to start. But before inserting the batteries do see the positive  negative marked side and insert the batteries according to the charge respectively.6. Close the battery lid and led will automatically start working. The battery lid needs a small screw to get fixed. so if u dont find the screw in any plastic packets then use another aftermarket screws or maybe the screw is present inside the locker mechanism.7. The locker mechanism screws can be unlocked by a particular opener which will be given with the mounting knots inside the locker.8. The locker is now ready to use. Remove the keys and use the led to unlock and lock it. The default password is 1234.9. Please donot apply any pressure or try to press the firm bolts of the locker mechanism when the locker is open. Let the motor of the locker do its work.10. If the locker shows any other error message. Do consult the user manual.Note. Please be calm and do things properly or else you might damage the product."
5,"Easy to operate.But installation is a head breaking thing. After repeated calls to Godrej customer care, finally they came after 20 days and charged 750 rupees for installation. Good for small stuff. Light weight hence it needs to be mounted in cupboard or wall otherwise it is light enough to be carried and run ;-) Best thing is that I got it in a deal 4200."
5,"How to set new password in home mode , there is no # key as mentioned in manual. Idot seller and supplier.Double click clear button- enter 751019-enter 171310- press lock three times- enter new password -enter lock .done new password is setIt is good safe"
2,"First it is made in China product which I was not expecting from Godrej.The safe arrived with dent and chipped paint at two places.manual with the product is obsolete.Instruction indicating 68# to program the lock but there is no # key on key pad, door was not align.Totally dissatisfied with the product quality."
3,The reason I declined the purchase was that it was to light.A thief can easily take it and open it in their own sweet time.Therefore I declined the purchase
5,Good product and provides good security. Provides a master pwd which can be used even if we forget regular pwd.Executive has provided DEMO on time after taking appointment by calling customer care. Charged 300/- for demo  installation.
5,"I love this digital safe locker. Now I can put all my important stuff inside this box. The good thing is that it is not that bulky. The material is also very good, seems very strong and heavy. And, It is very easy to install. I have not mounted/fixed it because I put this inside the almera. Now I can feel safer by keeping cash, passport and other valuable stuff.Lookwise also it just has a classy touch. It has a proper colored LED display. It works on the battery power and the consumption is very low. You can set your own passcode from the 4-8 digits. I like it beep sound whenever you have to press the keys. In addition it also has 2 emergency keys. Overall now I am very calm ever since this digital safe has been arrived. Of course now I can manage my things for my own peace of mind according to my needs :-).Earlier I never ever used such kind of digital safe but after have been started using  this I found this as exactly as what I expected for. Truly its a big value for money. I would highly recommend this product to everyone who read this review. Greets!*Please click the Helpful button if you like this review. Thank you!"
1,"Very bad product. The code doesn’t work suddenly. Trying to open it with override key n it won’t open. Tried calling the customer care n they say, I will be charged Rs.500 for the technician visit. It is only 2 months I bought it. Very bad product."
2,"Highly dissatisfied with the product. Received in package opened condition. Perfume bottle was almost empty. Though it was specified as returnable, but return not accepted. Finally its defective one as its not spraying after 10 mins, only the green light blinking and not starting spray even after 10 hrs. They say its so designed. Ridiculous I think. Moreover I bought। Another bottle of fragrance but its emptied within 2/3 days and 2/3 hrs a day of use. Though it was said to last 20000 sprays. Thats the product."
2,The smell is good but the arrmatic spray is not functioning properly. I have airwick also and airwick aermatic sprayers are excellent. Use Godrej refills with airwick sprayers. They fit perfectly
1,"Money wasted. The product does not work properly.  It sprayed 4-5 times, making me dispose the bill and box and it stopped working from next day. I had used Air Wick earlier and that worked perfectly. Avoid this product and from the seller as he may be clearing his defect stock."
1,"I really liked this product at first. I also loved the fragrance of lavender. But after 2 months, the motor stopped pressing the refill hard enough and the fragrance stopped. I changed the batteries but it was of no use. I even got Duracell batteries. Its of no use. The motor is not strong enough. Bad experience."
1,"Really disappointed with this product. It’s not even a month and this product is spraying continuously within seconds. I tried setting the timer on 10,20 and 40min intervals but it sprays within seconds. Can’t even return the product now because it is out of return window. The fragnance is pretty good but can’t believe that the machinery of this product have timer issues in just less than a month of use. Totally not recommended if you are bot looking to buy this product every month."
2,"Godrej failed to deliver the quality i expected , perfume of the spray lasted for just 10 days and after 10 days only gas was coming out from the refill and smell of the perfume was very less ,so i am not getting any kind of perfume  smell in my room  , dont buy it i also wrote a complaint to godrej consumer products regarding this issue of selling me inferior quality product which does not meets their reputation"
1,Worst product. Product is not working after 10days.
1,I have been ordering from cloudtail from a long time and I am not writing this for them...this is for the product which is a crap I have to take out the batteries and re put them everyday as the spray is not working and it’s just been 2 weeks of placing the product on wall..
1,It’s not working the spray point is getting pressed but it’s not functioning no spray out of it automatically.... unnecessarily I ordered the auto machine which is not as said at all... n I think it’s already a fault piece cos the cartoon of this product was also not perfect
1,"Recieved defective product and no option for replacement, simply waste if money.Seller and amazon should take responsibility for defective product as how can customer responsible for defective product received.CrapLooklike amazon cheating customer by putting crap rules and we dont find time to run behind consumer forum and amazon is taking advantage over the same"

1,The product was defective. The front keypad panel was not sitting properly. Same was immediately observed on receiving and opening the product. The defect was reported and Amazon has arranged a replacement. Have  informed Amazon to check and confirm that the product resent  is not defective and in order
5,"The product is good. The only caveat (as I have noticed so far) is to be careful with the alarm. Dont keep stuff on it after switching the alarm on. Second, I think the alarm tone itself should change. It needs to be ALARMING. The volume needs to be a bit on the higher side as well. One can easily muffle the sound with a blanket type of fabric and make a getaway. That said, it is quite a sleek gadget. Definitely worth more than what one would be paying for. Its a bit heavy, but I guess that needs to be part of the ""package"" so to speak."
5,"This is very handy and useful. I keep it inside my wardrobe and store my wallet, car key and other loose currency and change in it when I come back from office. So no more  carelessly placed wallet risking small stealing by maid. As I got the wardrobe made recently, I got a specially designed compartment to keep this safe. It works flawlessly and is very easy to operate.  If I want to lock all the other wardrobes at home while going out somewhere, I keep the keys inside this.  no need to carry so many keys with me. One needs to know the purpose of this safe and the way to use it."
5,"Using it since November 2016.Sleek and elegant. Sits nicely in my cupboard.Useful to keep certain small sized valuables like keys,cash,jewelry,certain documents,watches etc.The touch panel is great, feels soft and is responsive.Velvet lining is great.Portable.Only con I found is that it buzzez even if you close the cupboard door a bit hard.Other than that, Its good to have it.Note: Its not a regular heavy duty safe. Its more of a personal locker as mentioned. Dont expect it to be the most secure thing you can have."
1,"Bought godrej goldilock in the Amazon diwali sale.. In The product that I got,was having some scratches already. Still I kept it.  I wanted to disable the theft alarm because it gives a loud sound even if we move the goldilock slightly, which is very annoying. I tried to disable the feature but it was not getting disabled. The godrej executive also couldnt do it.. He told some problem is there in pcb and I should return the product.. I did it.. I got the product replaced by Amazon the very next day...Now the new product also has same problem. We cannot disable the alarm. Also it has one additional problem...when we close its lid, it sometimes doesnt get locked. After 2-3 attempts, it gets locked..Now I am confused, what to do with this.. I trusted godrej brand and Amazon.. But the satisfaction level is not at all there"
3,"Awesome packaging done by amazon !!Product review:Pros: 1.Easy to Carry  2.Touch screen is absolutely smooth.  3.Working mini safe with a primitive touch screen run by a 9 volt battery..well that is awesome.  4.Developers and Designers have done a great job in creating a sleek and stylish safe.Cons:  1.Although the safe looks great..not much space to place enough valuables.If u place a mobile,wallet and a wristwatch..space is done for.  2.Inner layer of the safe is made by a grossest material.Its so rough that it can scratch the back side of your iphone if havent placed carefully.  3.Wiring for this safe can be done better.  4.Default battery provided to you will be a GP 9 volt alkaline battery,Mine was pretty much messySo to sum this up,a fine product for occasional use (routine if you are thrifty enough to spend bucks on batteries) with a stylish look 🏻"
4,"I recently gifted this item to my parents on their anniversary. However the product is good and easy to use with a very responsive touch panel , it has to be absolutely stationary else the alarm sets off which makes it difficult to carry during transportation.Also the Godrej support team is not quick in answering your queries and I received a product which had few scratches on it. So, Amazon should ensure that the product appears brand new since the customers are paying them for a brand new product.  Overall its worth buying for your security needs."
4,"Product Is Excellent but the packaging was really terrible, I was shocked to see the box damaged like it was thrown in the warehouse or something, luckily the product was in mint condition.The locker is very very useful when you have domestic help around, this locker shall actually keep you stress free, the locker is very easy to operate during day or night due to led backlit number which are illuminated, overall a great buy wish Amazon improves the packaging on this product in the future....."
5,"If you have maids in the house and want to keep valuables like wallets and regular use small jewellery under lock and key while they go about their household chores and you dont want to carry physical keys either for fear of misplacing and searching for them or simply inconvenient for you, then this is the product to go for. Its small enough to sit on your study table or fit in your cupboard drawer..although you must understand That it cant fit more than 3 or 4 regular size mens wallets and some other knickknacks like ear rings, chains, cards etc. Easy to operate and install by reading instructions in manual. Sturdy enough to dissuade servants from physical tampering. Serves purpose for what it is intended to do."
2,"The locker I received has issues with getting closed. I has placed the battery and reset the Locking number. On closing however the locker didn’t get locked. I read troubleshooting however it didn’t help. Looks like the switch inside the locker which upon pressing shoots bolts, is faulty. Returning this."

1,My vegetables and fruit turned Black next day after UV treatments. I am not sure is it 4 tubes give access exposure .Now I am worried if it is good idea to use it for vegetables sanitization....
2,"Box seems good and alarm is set after 15 minutes and not 6 minutes as written in the discription . there is no indicator.How do we know that all four uv lights are working properly? In case any light is not working, how will we get to know?"
5,Thank you for changing the timer
5,Does its job. It has 4 lamps and mirrors on all sides unlike most competitors that have 2 lamps. Only grouse is the 15 minute timer is useless. I dont need to expose any object for 15 minutes. I open the box after 5 or 6 minutes. Should be enough when competitors whose boxes have only 2 lamps recommend 4 minutes to disinfect.Edit: The company replaced the timer from the previous 15 mins to 6 minutes on their own.
5,Best Product in these price segment.
1,The product specifications do not match the details on Amazon. NO BUZZER SOUND. No indicator lights either. You just have to wait like a fool to estimate the disinfection cycle which is claimed to last for 6 minutes. If you want it to be 20 minutes you either can have 18 minutes or 24 minutes and that too without any indications. Hope it has the genuine UV lights and the claim is not false on that count as well!GODREJ COULD NOT BE WORST THAN THIS!
1,"The product is useless, There is no indicator for power on,There is proper response either from Amazon and manufacturers.The customer care axecutive is not at all helpful. Want to return but customer care executive is not helpful."
4,4 lights are very useful for effective sanitization but they produce a bit more heat which is a kind of side effect. Depends on what you put inside the box .
5,"Overall Price is WORTH IT!Fits Laptop upto 14.1”, Helmet smaller size only, fruits and vegetable all can be put without issues. Looks pretty decent for your home!But;1. Smells horrible after every cycle (room gets polluted)2. One rack means effectively you can place 10-12 soaps.3. If you over stack them no disinfection possible. Take caution and do less and more cycles to ensure4. One switch operation (plug  play). Timer is to be followed manually or wait for beep (no display if you are curious to know what time has lapsed)5. Wire is three pin, so the earthing is critical, I felt some mild shocks."
1,"Useless product of two accounts:1. There is no timer. There is a flat cycle of 6 minutes before the buzzer rings2. The moment you open the door while the device is working, you can see the UV lamps for a fraction of a second which is a health hazard.This is a classic product where the practicality and safety have been ignored to cash into the fear pshycosis of the customers."

There was no such policy so I had to return it."

2,"The watch looks superb. Excellent finish. You get exactly what you see in the photos. Product rating is 5 star.BUT i dont think the seller , Cloudtail , handled the product properly. When i opened the box, to my disappointment i found the thin plastic that covers a new watch glass face is all crumpled up to a corner. I was scared thinking the glass face must be damaged, but thank God it wasnt the case. Also theres no dealer stamp in the warranty card.My take: if you really like what you see, go for it. And if you are scared to buy online then buy it from the brick mortar shops, cause its worth it."
5,"Very nice ,fast delivery, I like it"
5,Awesome watch. Love this product in this price
1,"The product is almost similar to the actual one.. But the day and date cycle not working properly.. And the week names are wrong.. Like Sunday written as SAB, MRI, and so on"
4,Good one .but date is wrongly represented
2,"I bought the watch for my father.Thank you Amazon for delivering it before the delivery date!The packaging, however; was bad. The box is made up of cardboard and the watch was already outside the box when delivered. Thankfully, it wasnt damaged.When I received the watch, it wasnt working, so I had to change the cell myself.The watch looks good and straps are sturdy enough.So if I had to rate,Delivery 4 starsThe product 4 starsPackaging 1 star"
5,"I dont have the photo of the watch to upload but believe me, the best watch your money can buy. It looks much better than it is shown in Amazon picture. Trust me go for it. No problem nothing, it went on ticking at one shot. For day setting, one is written in spanish and also in english. Date also accurate."

5,"I dont have the photo of the watch to upload but believe me, the best watch your money can buy. It looks much better than it is shown in Amazon picture. Trust me go for it. No problem nothing, it went on ticking at one shot. For day setting, one is written in spanish and also in english. Date also accurate."
4,Nice product
5,NYC watch  I m very happy timely delivery  bcz this watch gft my bf birthday  so thnx too Amazon  and most thnx fully deliver  dada
1,"Metal strip of watch not good, felt like duplicate of titan !! Not satisfied with the product.....this was not expected. Waste money"
5,Got it to gift a groom at his wedding. Beautiful timepiece. In fact I loved it do much Im getting one for myself. The black dial and the silver hands and silver marking makes the functioning of the watch look stunning and royal. Dial size is just right. It is definitely not small and it is not very big either. It looks very well balanced on the wrist. And the metal bracelet that comes with it is beautiful and goes perfectly with the timepiece dimension wise and theres no mismatch between them. Go for it without any second guessing. Youll love it ️ Thank you Amazon and thank you Titan. Both amazing companies and now you both have a very very happy and loyal customer in me for life.
5,Very good and simple looking watch. Hopefully quality will also be expected as from Titan
5,"Specially I like the dial diameter which is not very large, perfectly fits on my hand."
5,Beautiful
4,Got it delivered yesterday. My wrist is very small and most of the watches look odd on my wrist. For this reason I dont like to use watches. Recently I decided to get a watch myself and after thorough browsing I chose to buy this one. The dial is small and doesnt look odd on small wrists. But the chain strap should have been more elegant and thee locking system shld have been easy. All in all this watch didnt disappoint me.
5,"Awesome Watch with a classy look in an affordable price tag (puja festive offer- 1256/-) from TITAN... Go for it.. you never regret ... Get the item in two days in puja season... so Special thanks to amazon seller ...only problem, I was  not quite satisfied by the packaging.

4,"This is my personal feedback as per my preference.I bought this watch along with the CHAPS watch.I found the overall look  functionality of CHAPS better than this one.The dial does not look much attractive to me as it looks  feels bulky but not big, also there is a big bezel which steals away the look.Although the overall quality is superb, no doubt about it as its a watch by Titan.So decide for urself as I have attached couple of pictures to justify my feedback."

4,"Taste resembles that there is 45% mango pulp in solution. It tastes like a natural mango. If you are not being able to get natural mango shake during season, it may be preferred in off season over other mango juice like Frooti etc."
5,"Tastes good, one can make out no preservatives or sugar is added. But pls know it is not juice it is mango pulp (aamras).  i feel Paperboat is an Indian company, though not yet researched. All in all a good buy."

4,Its all perfect except the price per ltr of this aamras if it was around 120Rs/ltr then it would be nice.

5,"Nice as always.An extra-ordinary experience in terms of service, quality, affordability  accessibility to products of great value, which otherwise wouldnt have been possible if not for Amazon’s amazing dedication......"
5,Love Coke!Yes the cans were great and at a good price too
1,"Out of 6 cans, 5 were puffed and one was a sealed but EMPTY can  photos and videos attached. Highly disappointed. Please refund my money"
5,"U may recieve a coke can slightly damaged during transit, but it is 100%original....price is affordable and good deal in good price,specially in this corona.......Beat the Heat with this soft drink......serve chilled .........cool beverage....."
3,The can are damaged as per the photo. That came out from the plastic wrapper with coke written on it.Not sure if this has happened due to transit or from manufacturing.However I am not satisfied. I ordered this product as I love the original taste.I might not get my value from the product now.Viraj Mohan
5,"Firstly i dont understand what does ""Warmth"" in this review means.Coke is supposed to be consumed cold so warmth is out of my scope of my intelligence.Since lock down, have not been able to get these cans. All grocery stores have pet bottles and as soon as this was listed. Ordered one."
3,"I received 6 cans of coke, out of which one seemed lighter than normal. It was immediately clear that the can had lesser liquid. I checked for any damage or leakage, but there was none. I have posted photographs of the defective can and a normal one, and the weight displayed is a clear indication.Again, i would like to emphasize that the can was not damaged and the photographs are not edited."
4,"Overall a good deal. Packing was not good and there were swellings due to pressure buildup, but no complaints. Got it at Rs 199 for 6 cans. Highly recommended.Hope this review is helpful."
5,got in 210 rs quick delivery n affordable price thanks amazon product delivered without getting a little scratch
5,Got it for 160/- 100% value for money taste was  like original  coco cola packaging was also good
5,"Nice as always.An extra-ordinary experience in terms of service, quality, affordability  accessibility to products of great value, which otherwise wouldnt have been possible if not for Amazon’s amazing dedication......"
5,Love Coke!Yes the cans were great and at a good price too
1,"Out of 6 cans, 5 were puffed and one was a sealed but EMPTY can  photos and videos attached. Highly disappointed. Please refund my money"
5,"U may recieve a coke can slightly damaged during transit, but it is 100%original....price is affordable and good deal in good price,specially in this corona.......Beat the Heat with this soft drink......serve chilled .........cool beverage....."
3,The can are damaged as per the photo. That came out from the plastic wrapper with coke written on it.Not sure if this has happened due to transit or from manufacturing.However I am not satisfied. I ordered this product as I love the original taste.I might not get my value from the product now.Viraj Mohan
5,"Firstly i dont understand what does ""Warmth"" in this review means.Coke is supposed to be consumed cold so warmth is out of my scope of my intelligence.Since lock down, have not been able to get these cans. All grocery stores have pet bottles and as soon as this was listed. Ordered one."

2,"you should not label a product as ""Natural Juice"" if it is a mixture of some juice with water and sugar and other flavorings including artificial flavors.  It doesnt taste badly but for anyone who bought it thinking it was going to be a liter of Natural Mango Juice, it is a very disappointing experience.  Why not be honest??"
3,"I have bought this item a few times from Amazon. This morning however, I ordered it from Amazon Fresh and was shocked to be delivered a carton that was soaked in rat urine and stinking. You can see from the picture how terrible it looked. The juiceboxes inside werent damaged but the stench of leptospirotic urine is unbearable and other packaged foods were in the same grocery bag!Amazon Fresh items cannot be returned or replaced, unfortunately, so I am stuck with this. Have to discard the juice boxes."
1,Very very bad product.. Didnt expect this quality from B Natural.. I m a regular B Natural customer.. Mainly guava... This time i tried mango... V poor taste... Completely artificial n very diluted drink too.. Thumbs down from me
2,Taste of juice is ok not best . Much sugar added to manufacturing  tags of natural ingredients is only for marketing purpose. No any brand provide natural taste because of its processing way. As a costumer we understood that avoid it . Take a slice of fruit is better than...
5,Actually I have ordered for mango juice but I have been supplied with Litchi Juice. It is 2nd time this has happened in this month itself. This unethical to your standard and do the precautionary measures to avoid such mistakes
5,Best packing for this type of the product and Also...the quality of the product...
5,Taste is very good. I got it in just 168/- Good taste and juice consumption is a good practice for health !
5,The taste was awesome and the juice was thick. Value for money ....Loved it !!
4,Tastes like original mango pulp and acidic. Very good.
5,quality and product is very good. And this is definitely worth for your money

1,Family fun pack! They supposedly forgot to mention its as ant family. God dammit there was live  ants in it! Are you serious! I just throwed it
1,The product is expired or something is very wrong with these Maggie.... Got stomach problems after eating them... They smell different and the best part is we cannot even return them
1,This product was supplied in damaged condition.The package is damaged and full of ants inside.Also the app states this product do not qualify for return.
1,Can you use a product when it is tasted by mouse before? Even last month I received suji with same condition but nobody listening. We are promoting amazon prime to all our friends  we are receiving defective grocery. Need help
5,"Maggi is called national food of India, lol. Its tasty and non sticky and can be prepared easily and quickly. So feeling hungry? Its maggi time now.Packaging and delivery was good and prompt. The noodles were recently made so it was a fresh product. Recommend to every age group as a quick snack."
5,"Review of maggi:Who am I to review Maggi. Its iconic for anyone born in the 80s and 90s.Review of this pack:1) better than large packs that you have to store in the open2) Lasts longer than regular pack of eight, again because its closed.Disadvantage :More plastic usage than regular pack or tenConclusion:If you are going to consume Maggi over longer period of time but this one, if you will finish pack of ten within a week buy the regular large packs as it saves plastic pollution--"
1,"Seems damaged pack delivered with ants inside. Not one or two, thousands of them . Ants spread in whole kitchen now."
5,"I just love the 2 minute noodle !Pros-1. Broken during delivery or not, doesnt really matter to me, since I prefer to break them into 2 pieces anyways before I cook them2. This family big pack really is cost effective.3. Nestle maggi has been around for so many decades from my childhood and they have been consistent and have even braved the recent questions raised on the quality of their product!4. Masala taste is ever so tasty5. Cooks really fast...ok not 2, lets say 5mins!Cons-1. Though maggi comes with atta noodles (healthier) than this maggi, the atta maggi is quiet expensive than this normal maggi. How I wish the oats and atta maggi would have been cheaper too"

1,"Returned as the product was of manufactured in june and i have buy this on 2nd oct, expired one."
4,"Seems to be a monopoly. No competitor that’s why charging so much.But yes., adds a reason to have a boaring food with ease"
5,You do not need a feedback for an establishment as Amul! They have been pampering all our taste-buds since decades. Lovely product and the only butter brand out there in the market I ever use.
5,"I think Amul can never have competition in its dairy products, not at least on its butter.Amul butter has been my favourite since childhood and not a single breakfast or sandwich or cooked/baked dish has gone without Amul butter.A butterlicious product, the very best.Carmelita FernandesFood  Travel Writer"
5,"Amuls Famous Slogan, and ofcourse my favourite too""Utterly Butterly Delicious AMUL."
5,"Amazing product from Amul, the taste has remained same throughout the years and the quality is still awesome.And as always amazing delivery from amazon"
1,Amul supports anti-national channels so I am discontinuing use of the products and there are better butter available from local manufacturers.
5,Amul name is enough and Amazon service as usual prompt
5,"In terms of flavour, others are far apart, cant really call anyone a competitor for amul butter, in India."
5,Its amul. Its the best. I made this order after having checked more store in person. The store has more offers than online.

2,A good ghee is granular and thick. This one is more like oil on top and looks granular in the bottom of the bottle. Disappointing as it neither has the flavour or taste of a ‘shush ghee’
5,Cow ghee is always lighter but not thick. It has not higher cholesterol as buffalo ghee. Coming to the brand wise Amul is the best brand. As all buffalo ghee has more aroma different to cow ghee. It us the words best ghee.

5,Tried this paneer for the first time apprehensively. Surprisingly its good in terms of texture and quality. Soft enough and decent portion size. Economical given home made Paneer during quarantine is an expensive affair as milk prices are exorbitant.Made some amazing gravy with same. Will definitely order again.Came hygienically packed in a vacuum bag and has a 45day validity. By processed food standards it is excellent not chewy or smelly like most dairy brands but then again its an Amul product cant go wrong really.Thanks Amazon fresh for the prompt delivery.
4,The product mrp shows ₹73 but charged ₹80 by Amazon Fresh. Product quality is good.
5,During this indefinite lockdown this paneer has definitely been a saviour.The best part is that the expiry date is almost 45 days. This helps to stock and store paneer and use it as and when need be which actually is not possible with any fresh dairy paneer. It is not very soft like your fresh paneer but still it tastes good enough.I have made tandoori and chinese recipes using this block of paneer and i keep reordering too.
1,"""Fresh"" with just 4-5 more days to expiry received."
5,I tried Amul Fresh Paneer Block for the first time since today early morning  I needed it to make Paneer Pizza and amazingly it turned out to be Yummy!! The paneer is quite soft and was delivered  on priority though some might feel it to be expensive  but it really adds fresh flavour and colour to you Delicacies!
5,"Amul Paneer is probably the best paneer that you can get in the market. If you get it fresh (which I did) then it has the right consistency, feel and taste. Nothing beats Amul."
1,"Well, Amul product is nice n trustworthy but only point is that this product was delivered to us when it was reaching about its expiry date"
3,"Amul panner was good, but found Nandini (KMF) panner was more goid/tasty"

5,Bitterresssssssstttt of all...Tastes bitter. No sugarhaving a piece of it. I ordered 4. Will finish it in 4 months time.Eat it as a medicine. Only for dark chocolate loversLots of minerals in it.Good source of antioxidants. Lowers bad cholesterols. Numerous benefits Google it friends.Good for heart and high BP and diebetic patients. I give it to my father (60) also.May work as an antidepressant too.Not a sweetner. But  a nutrient rich food.First 2-3 days it was difficult to eat but now its good. After all health is wealth.Great work Amul #FIT INDIA MOVEMENTDo not discontinue production this chocolate AMUL like you did for 90% cocoa. Retain this as your permanent product. Please give micronutrients information also in the chocolate.
5,All the chocolate lovers will love this chocolate! (P.S. I said chocolate lovers not sugar lovers.). Its absolutely one of the best dark chocolates in India. You can go for it only if you are a die hard fan of cocoa! Order delivered was absolutely fresh and was in the finest state.
5,"Chocolate didnt melt in transit to Bhubaneswar( doesnt melt in transit to Bengaluru either).I love dark chocolate and can eat comfortably till Amul 90%, so wanted to try the ultimate 99% but found it a little too bitter for my taste so now I use it to make hot chocolate and it tastes much better than Hersheys. Just chop this chocolate into small pieces and stir it in your milk!"
5,"Bitter is a very silple word, need some terrible word to describe this, i dont think i can go beyond 70% cocao... now i dont know what i will do with two bars.... on a lighter note: guys think twice before ordering, this is some 3rd degree torture not for general public use, might help military to torture terrorists. If i was a terrorist i would speak out everything after eating this in return of sugar..Jokes apart guys this is best and cheapest you can get, well done,  amul really the taste of india "
5,"Its DARK AND BITTER, so if youre one of those sweet suger filled fake chocolate lovers, than this is out of your league, stick to your sugar candies.Its extremely hard to find anything this dark in India and even if there are, theyre extremely pricy cause of low quantity production. Thanks to AMUL, now we have true dark chocolate at affordable price.NB: Loving the texture and feel of the chocolate. Im really happy.Update: Finished 4 packs in less than 13 days. Ordered another 4. I just love the texture of the chocolate in my mouth. Truly in love ️"
5,Its literally heavenly feeling to taste this chocolate. The chocolate is bitter to the core. It has no added suger. Sugery chocolate/fake chocolate lovers wont like it. Its for those people who has developed taste for cocoa/cacao over the period of time. Its made for chocolate connoisseur. Price is very less when compare to other brands in market. Plus Amul is well-known brand itself. Packaging was nice.
5,"I simply love this pure cocoa taste....not sure if people consider this bitter, I personally do not feel so, may be very mildly. But the cocoa taste, flavor indeed feels great.I had earlier tasted upto 90% dark among the Amul chocolates ( of course couple of other makes including Lindt). In fact I have graduated in darkness with Amuls progression in a way starting at 55% then 75, 90 and now 99% - in fact love the whole range by Amul. As long as this range is available I will never have to look beyond for Dark chocolates. Thanks Amul. In fact on an earlier occasion I had purchased 99% dark of some other make and did not like the flavor at all - strangely it had kind of a sourish smell and so far a bit hesitant with this item as well at first.Another thing the chocolates were delivered superbly packaged - thanks to the seller. Had a carton box outside and inside of it the chocolate packs had a layer of some kind of gel filled plastic bags to keep the chocolates at non melting temperature....pretty cool - so no melting problem or anything for me.So this would be my daily dose of dark chocolate from now on like a cube (or sometimes two) after each meal - enjoyable in taste, and so sugar, no guilt!!"
4,"So basically, this is not the chocolate for everyone. At first when I tasted it, I badly regretted buying it. It tasted nowhere near the chocolate you would find in the market. There isnt even the slightest hint of any kind of sweetness in it and most people would find it gross. But the more I ate it, the more I could feel its richness and realised how decadent it is. Its not a chocolate, its THE chocolate."
5,"Amul 99% cacao is the best dark/bitter chocolate available in India... excellent innovation by Amul. I may tell that I am not endorsing Amul or any other brand...just my own opinions. It has been proven that cacao is one of the healthiest superfoods on earth with amazing health benefits. Its full of antioxidants  flavonoids which increase lifespan. Its one of the highest sources of nitric oxide which dilates/widens  relaxes blood vessels of the body by reducing blockages, thereby supporting heart  brain health. Cacao is also anti inflammatory and anti carcinogenic, thus reduces cancer risk. Moreover, cacao is a natural blood thinner, so can prevent blood clots, reduce blood cholesterol  blood sugar and lower blood pressure. Overall Amul dark cacao chocolate has enormous health benefits...so we must be thankful to Amul for making such an awesome health food. Please ignore the negative and one star rated reviews as those people are ignorant and lack awareness. Requesting all the sugar lovers...please dont defame such a nice and healthy product by giving negative ratings and one star. I pity those innocent sweet toothed people which focus on tongue taste rather than general health. Again, I am not promoting Amul company or a representative of the same, these are my personal views  experience. Those who want to enhance quality of life and reduce onset of lifestyle/genetic diseases like cancer, diabetes, hypertension, stroke, heart attacks, cardiac arrest, etc must not think twice...just purchase the stuff  enjoy. Infact, Amul 99% Cacao Chocolate is a heavenly bliss with irresistible taste. It is indeed Delightful  Ambrosial. I am giving a five star rating to this authentic product...if there were 10 stars, I would have given full 10/10. Lastly, thanks to Amul  Amazon, too for providing such a nice superfood at my doorstep."
5,"Its dark, bitter but thats what the product is all about. Though it took almost 1 week for delivery, the chocolate didnt melt luckily. Good packaging by the seller.I fell the chocolate is not made with the finest of cocoa seeds. But I like it."

As long as this range is available I will never have to look beyond for Dark chocolates. Thanks Amul. In fact on an earlier occasion I had purchased 99% dark of some other make and did not like the flavor at all - strangely it had kind of a sourish smell and so far a bit hesitant with this item as well at first.Another thing the chocolates were delivered superbly packaged - thanks to the seller. Had a carton box outside and inside of it the chocolate packs had a layer of some kind of gel filled plastic bags to keep the chocolates at non melting temperature....pretty cool - so no melting problem or anything for me.So this would be my daily dose of dark chocolate from now on like a cube (or sometimes two) after each meal - enjoyable in taste, and so sugar, no guilt!!"
4,"So basically, this is not the chocolate for everyone. At first when I tasted it, I badly regretted buying it. It tasted nowhere near the chocolate you would find in the market. There isnt even the slightest hint of any kind of sweetness in it and most people would find it gross. But the more I ate it, the more I could feel its richness and realised how decadent it is. Its not a chocolate, its THE chocolate."
5,"Amul 99% cacao is the best dark/bitter chocolate available in India... excellent innovation by Amul. I may tell that I am not endorsing Amul or any other brand...just my own opinions. It has been proven that cacao is one of the healthiest superfoods on earth with amazing health benefits. Its full of antioxidants  flavonoids which increase lifespan. Its one of the highest sources of nitric oxide which dilates/widens  relaxes blood vessels of the body by reducing blockages, thereby supporting heart  brain health. Cacao is also anti inflammatory and anti carcinogenic, thus reduces cancer risk. Moreover, cacao is a natural blood thinner, so can prevent blood clots, reduce blood cholesterol  blood sugar and lower blood pressure. Overall Amul dark cacao chocolate has enormous health benefits...so we must be thankful to Amul for making such an awesome health food. Please ignore the negative and one star rated reviews as those people are ignorant and lack awareness. Requesting all the sugar lovers...please dont defame such a nice and healthy product by giving negative ratings and one star. I pity those innocent sweet toothed people which focus on tongue taste rather than general health. Again, I am not promoting Amul company or a representative of the same, these are my personal views  experience. Those who want to enhance quality of life and reduce onset of lifestyle/genetic diseases like cancer, diabetes, hypertension, stroke, heart attacks, cardiac arrest, etc must not think twice...just purchase the stuff  enjoy. Infact, Amul 99% Cacao Chocolate is a heavenly bliss with irresistible taste. It is indeed Delightful  Ambrosial. I am giving a five star rating to this authentic product...if there were 10 stars, I would have given full 10/10. Lastly, thanks to Amul  Amazon, too for providing such a nice superfood at my doorstep."
5,"Its dark, bitter but thats what the product is all about. Though it took almost 1 week for delivery, the chocolate didnt melt luckily. Good packaging by the seller.I fell the chocolate is not made with the finest of cocoa seeds. But I like it."
5,"Amul all the way I dont think it needs a review the name speaks for itself.. And Amazon, as usual, was good and prompt in services"
5,Delivered in cold box! Bravo.
4,"Taste is better than competitors.  My kids love it more than Britannia , GO cheese and Milky mist."

1,I ordered amul fresh creme it was just look like this when I opened the package I didnt even used it once ...so regretful for buying this product
5,"The cream is of good quality. See the fat percentage to choose cream for the type of cooking you need it for. This is good for everyday use. A tip to ensure it lasts mire than 2 days is to keep it right in front of the fridge cooling vent, this helps it last for a week or so. Freezing doesnt help, it changes the taste and texture."
4,General product but do check the manufacturing  expiry dates.
3,"It is good for other dishes but not for whipped cream icing,I tried it for icing and as it is not a nondairy cream it had very little fat and thickness and more of liquidy milk which made the consistency wattery and think,Otherwise it is great for other dishes,for icing non-dairy whipped cream would be better"
5,"I tried making whipping cream with it and it really turned out well, used it for cake decoration and  it turned out really well 🏻"
5,It is very good product to add creaminess and texture to add to dishes. The taste is very nice.
3,Whilst initially the cream is thick.  Subsequently the content starts thinning out into thick milk like.  Guess if it comes I. Tins like other oversea product it might have better consistency.  Surely Thant would be at a higher price.
4,Good and Tasty
5,Best
5,Cool packaging and fresh product.

5,"Amul is a very old and trusted brand. I typically purchase Mother Dairy / Amul Ghee - depending upon which one is at a better price (per kg )or on offer :)As usual, good quality ghee. No issues at all. Amazon does good delivery in Mumbai, be it Prime Now or Pantry. So no complaints.Go for it - wont be disappointed."
1,I NOT LIKED IT.
1,"Looks like a spoiled / duplicate product , packing date is 15th May 2020 the product isnt expired one"
1,Guys dont order Amul ghee from amazon fresh the seller is selling some duplicate stuff.I got ill after having this.I hardly write reviews but this one i am writing just to warn all that dont purchase amul ghee from fresh at alllllll.You can see the picture.Even after putting it on burner it doesnt melt.
1,"3rd time Ive ordered this Ghee.*1st time: Ghee was perfect, it solidified, tasted gr8-directly  in my BulletProof Coffee.*2nd time: Tasted poor, directly  in my BPC, never solidified  my Mother said the same too.*3rd time: Thought the 2nd time was a batch problem. But the problem has repeated. It does not solidify,  TASTES EVEN WORSE (directly  indirectly) than the 2nd time.p.s. my coffee ingredients are the same.No More Amul Ghee, guess a lot of potential for adulteration within their scope of products  quality control. Mother Dairy, Dynamic much much better.Amul Ghee has lost a customer."
2,"Bad quality. I think Amul made this low quality product for online shopping perpose only.  Amul ghee from local shop, in tin container is GOOD."
1,Poor quality..Seems as was adulterated..Fake product

5,I JUST LOVED THIS PRODUCT THERE IS NO COMPARISON OF THIS RIGHT NOW IN THE MARKET IN THE FLAVOUR OF CHOCOLATE MILK DRINK.ONLY HERSHEYS CHOCOLATE SYRUP COME CLOSE TO THIS WHICH IS EXPENSIVE  DIFFERENT PURPOSE.
5,The Best Health Drink for the whole family.Amul Pro is the only Health Drink available in the market at most economical Price Tag.And that too Made in India by Amul.
5,"Best product comparison to Bournvita, Horlicks chocolate, low price , good test, better value of nutrition and little part of DHA also. Amul is Indian brand must purchase this product. Packaging good and fast delivery by Amazon. Thanks  Amazon"
4,"Due to price reason, I doubt its effectiveness. Though I trust Amul a lot. Waiting for results. As far as flavour is concerned, its awesome."
3,Taste is nice but i think malt win is better than this

5,"One of the best products, highly recommended."
5,My daughter loves this drink. It tastes delicious n is very healthy too.

3,milk got spoiled when we boiled it. not upto the mark.
5,Excellent quality milk. Thick and tasty. Works very well for making curd at home. Ensure you boil and then cool it down to warm temperature before putting it down to make curd. Otherwise can be consumed without boiling. Thanks to Amul for making it available across India. Only drawback is the additional cost we have to pay compared to Nandini and other common brands.
5,Very convenient to store. One doest need to buy every day  assured quality. Curd is fantastic. I store 10ltrs  forget for 15 days.
1,I got the expired pack..
5,"Tastes like normal pouch bag milk. Feels no difference unlike other brands which though taste good, sometimes are a lot thicker to seem real milk."
5,"Same taste as the store bought Gold. Moreover, tetra pack is awesome as it can be recycled and hence, environment friendly. Though a little bit pricier than those plastic pouches yet worth it, considering our future."
2,"Not like milk.its a cream coloured solution ( not white like natural milk or daily packed milk) likely soya milk as its taste tells,and it sticks to walls of container.again a sign of some powdered or soya milk.not a good choice only an emergency option occasionally."
1,"Sheer waste of money as the Milk got curdled on the last two occasions that I ordered.It appears that delivering the packets during this hot season without adequate precaution spoils the milk.Although the packet states that no refrigeration is required till opened, however it also mentions that the packets are to be stored in a cool place.Thus the careless transportation in an ordinary vehicle in hot weather is bound to have an adverse impact on the milk."
2,"Spoilt. Perhaps it is being stored or transported in harsh sunlight or something. For the past several months, several of my orders of these have been spoilt.  Curdled milk,straight from a fresh carton,  each time."
5,Got it for little less than ₹ 50Value for money in this price.

1,Never buy this.. giving duplicate product..its not original ghee rather mixture of oil and vanaspati..no aroma on cooking..taste too bad...and smells on heating
1,"I ordered for patangali 2  1 leter pouches,,but 1 is correct weight and another is less waight"
3,I am not satisfied with the quality of Ghee. It doesnt have any smell and its very iight.  Mother Dairy ghee is far better than this. Overall its a 50-50 purchase .
4,"Patanjali made cow milk deshi ghee is best of availed among all similar type of fmcg product, it taste was not so good but fair colour was same as normal home made deshi ghee have it also have a qr code which varifies that it is a original prodct made by patanjali so,finally I like to give a rating feedback to this deshi ghee product which is 08/10 it means 08 out of 10."
1,"Just got this butter. I read nutritional information on the package and found that the amount of TRANS FAT does not match the description! The description indicates 0%, but actually 3%. For such a famous brand as Patanjali shamefully deceiving. I require update the nutritional information in product description!"
5,"Hi All,As I cut opened the pack I was really amazed by the ghee quality. We usually assume patanjali products to be  low/poor quality since it is manufactured indigenously or may be because we are already habitual of using Costly products. You may find the price hike too much of this Ghee, I can assure you it is because the quality is really authentic. I do not have the images of the ghee now. Ghee is thick, pale white in color. And taste so Delicious. The aroma is so authentic.It has long shelf life. However, I have recently started making Full cream cow milk ghee at home.Will definitely recommend everyone to try this Ghee."
3,"No issue with quality of Ghee. But the 1 litre Ghee is supposed to be consumed in a span of 09 months and the product which you had sent, was made in Dec. 2017. Already 07 months have passed. It means we will have to consume this 1 litre of Ghee in a span of two months. We were expecting fresh packet.  Disappointed with the seller."
1,This product is worst...They are using duplicate ghee in this parcel...They mixed many other things in ghee...I threw it outside...Hate this
1,First time i tried a patanjali product.. Its just waste of our hard earning money.. There is  nothing to say positively.. Its not a ghee.It dosent smell like ghee either taste.. Just like vanaspathi/cheap oil.. Dont try to buy this patanjali ghee.. Else ready to write a frusturated review like this😬
1,Very bad. No smell at all.wasted my money.

5,Undoubtedly the best cows milk we have ever tasted out of a Milk carton. Creamy and delicious.
5,"real cow milk without any preservatives, i have tried almost all tetrapak milk of all brands from last 6 months this really best. i really like see more product on this site of patanjali milk original molk products, Thank you Amazon."
5,Thick cow milk.  Very tasty.  Comparable with Amul Gold in thickness.  Although this is cow milk and not buffalo milk.  Tastes better than toned milk.
1,Spoilt milk
5,Best carton milk available in market.

5,"There are very few Ghee in market which does not have trans fats! Be it Amul, Mother dairy, Nestle, all have trans fats which are very very bad for health. Surpirsingly, patanajali ghee is without trans fats!"
1,"Worst ghee that is coming in Market. It tastes, smells and looks like dalda. I am sure its 100% dalda"
5,Tried almost all Ghee brands available in the market but I always have to come back to Patanjali Ghee. I didnt find any other brand to give the same flavor and texture.
3,Patanjali Ghee is not that pure or real Ghee smell like expected.Its like ordinary and looks like refined oil mixed with pure ghee.In comparison Nandini ghee or Jharana Ghee is better than this.Next time will try Amul or some organic brand or make at Home if I need pure ghee.I know how does the pure ghee smells like. Conclusion - Patanjalii is not upto the mark...
5,"No matter what you think of Patanjali.But some products are just too good. The best of them is this ghee.The smell, taste and quality. , its a must in every kitchen."
2,I generally like Patanjali products but really didn’t like this Ghee. The gravity is not good and this doesn’t feel like what original ghee should be like.
1,No where near to the pure Cow Ghee. I dont know why people are crazy about it.
2,This does not have aroma of a good ghee. Color is also yellow like butter. I do not recommend for people looking to buy pure ghee for kids.
4,Patanjali Products are reliable.  However the flavour of Ghee is less when compared to other products in the market.  May be because there are no additives and the process of preparing may be different
5,The purity of the Patanjali Cows Ghee.
5,"There are very few Ghee in market which does not have trans fats! Be it Amul, Mother dairy, Nestle, all have trans fats which are very very bad for health. Surpirsingly, patanajali ghee is without trans fats!"

4,"This product from patanjali can be a nightmare for your skin. Although the fragrance is good and it is a cheap product but thats all. I have normal skin and am not very prone to pimples. But after applying this gel for a couple of days, I started having pimples on my face. First I ignored, thinking it could be a result of the weather. But then the pimples started increasing. I immediately discontinued the product. But still I am unable to get rid of the pimples."
4,"I use this gel as my night cream and I am quite happy with it. It doesnt make me a beauty queen overnight, but moisturizes my skin the non-intrusive way, and thats what I need. The impact is for a short time, as it would naturally be. Its a good replenishment especially in summers.Only thing I think they can improve is change the packaging and use a bit high quality one. The cap is quite sharp to open and close. This can hurt if not operated carefully. Secondly, its a tube. You usually, habitually, keep the tube inverted with cap down to take out the gel. When you open with cap down, the hard cap and not so thick gel work in conjunction and it opens with a jerk, throwing some of gel around, wasting as well as messing things around at times. I now, open the cap with cap on top and then invert the tube to take it out. I learnt after some messes. This is too much to be careful about and Patanjali sure needs to work on the packaging front of this gel."
5,"Very very very good for skin and hair ..i really appreciate it..if you have suffer minor skin infections , pimple ,acne and hair fall problem then go for it"
5,Good gelIt really prevents pimplesGood for all types of skinCan use as night cream as well as primer
4,This is the best one for my skin type. In summers I have a acne prone combination skin and in winters I have a sensitive dry skin  it is a miracle for my skin. And it is affordable too  peeps of my skin type just give it a shot. Just wash your face with low ph cleanser at night and apply it. leave it on till the next day mrng. Your skin will be so supple and soft. My acne got reduced eventually in 1month 
1,The product i buy for rs 90 but when i received it was charged about 140rs i donno why..After using it i got alot of pimples on my face disappointed with patanjali...
5,Using it second time... good
5,i bought  it for 2nd time very satisfied
5,"Packing was fresh, overall nice. Helps the skin to feel fresh during winters. Also helpful in case of burns.Got it at 15% discount in form of amazon pay."
5,I have tried various other creams/gels on my skin for a year but nothing worked until I used this one. Acne marks started getting lighter almost within a week after using this twice a day as per instructions:)

1,Was delivered the incorrect product variant.I purchased the Pine fragrance—I received the lime variant instead.Its not a small difference. It matters to me. I hate the smell.
5,Best. Smells awesome. And Its Dettol. So I can trust it blindly.
4,"I mainly use this for spraying on bugs n spiders at house, mixed with water and vinegar. Sometimes for bath and washing baby clothes. Safe on hands and overall a useful product."
4,"Good fresh smell, but be sure to dilute this before using.Useful on disinfecting things like Clothes, bathing, door handles or even on your smartphones screen if its really dirty just clean it with damp cloth apply little of this. Always dilute before use. For stronger applications use the brown one."
5,"Dettol is always the best...this new disinfectant cleanser is good for cleaning household things... I divide the bottle in three parts  add water in it to make 3 liters . With spray holder bottle I spray on the things which comes thru delivery, household goods of course doors  handles...like it ...moreover it’s a pack of two. Value for money.."
5,A refreshing change from the original dettol which has a very antiseptic smell. This has a nice fragrance and Im sure has the same Dettol protection that weve trusted over the years. Wish it were a little more economical though
5,"Its not an antiseptic like regular dettol, its disinfectant used for mobbing floors. So it should not be used for shaving purposes"
5,"Supply water in Delhi has foul smell, this liquid certainly makes that smell gone! Plus killing the germs!I use it daily for bathing and washing clothes too!Online deal is good as I bought this at discounted price!Both variants smell fine! Blue and green"
1,Damaged product found seal broken and difference in quantity in each bottle
4,Good for floors but wont recommended for daily bath or baby bath and in washing because of fragrance. The original Dettol liquid is recommended for bath and washing.

5,"As Civilisation came to a stick end, the remaining Survivors fought over the last piece of the famed Antiseptic, claimed to be effective against all manners of Germs that covered the world. Finally, only a handful remained to satiate the desire of those who would be quick enough to steal these. Was it then worth it, for one man, to serve his own self, to grab the last Dettol? Over those that truely needed it, like healers of the sick people, or seek the ire of hoarders, who wanted the Last Dettol at any cost? The answer is yes, for not only this Dettol is effective as an Antiseptic, but also smells nice."
5,Original product
5,"We all know the Dettol brand.  I grew up with this brand back home in Sydney.  I am not fond of the alleged disinfectants at the local markets.  Good to see Dettol expanded.  I use this in my floor wash, you only need a very tiny amount as it soaps up,  I do mix it with a little lizzol to other floor cleaner.  Great for the bathroom and kitchen do.  Happy customer!!"
5,"Dettol is no doubt a good brand for disinfectant liquids. As compare to dettol original, this Lime fragrance gives a fresh feel after using. Can use for floors, kitchen tiles, bathroom, laundry  shaving purpose. I use this disinfectant liquid with water in this COVID-19 pandemic to wash products and spray on doors, door bell, all surfaces etc. We can use this for bathing purpose also. It is multi-purpose cleaner is safe on skin and on all surfaces. Nice way to disinfect your home."
5,Protect your loved ones from virus like COVID 19 dettol disinfectant liquid is one of the best solution. Although its scentless but you can use it as a laundry sanitizer or to disinfect anything which comes under human contact.
5,"I have never purchased this variety before. I have always used dettol antiseptic liquid. But during lock-down it was vanished from local medicine stores. So I moved online, it was even difficult to get one there also. However, after lots of attempt I got 1. After using this for shaving purpose I think it is equally good as antiseptic variety. It leaves a freshness felling after washing face with this. This leaves a refreshing fragrance if mixed with bathing water. I am very much pleased after using this variety and will buy this again in future."
5,"Great product from Dettol. As advertised, it can be used in bathing, shaving, laundry disinfection, floor cleaning, kitchen  bathroom cleaning, refrigerator and cleaning other substances."
1,To be honestly i have been using regular brown colour antiseptic liquid and i loved it so i thought to buy lemon scent liquid in hope that it will be much good than last one. But when i saw its much sticky liquid and when we add it in water it goes like invisible.. Very dissapointed -_- last one brown was more better but this one thumbs down.. Dont buy dont go on reviews.. I was purchased on reviews too.. U will regret once u use.. scent 2/10Thickness 2/10..really dont buy dont waste ur money on lemon.. Buy brown liquid
4,"There are plenty of other brands which are similar to Dettol but the question is whether you can trust it or not.  In my home the product is used as mixture with water for rinsing clothes, mopping floor and as spray-liquid to disinfect. It is a also a part of the first-aid box. The fresh lime fragrance smells great."
4,"Dettol is no doubt an authentic product. This Dettol Liquid is the totally different from the original antiseptic liquid. Its smell not Very strong like Antiseptic Liquid,its lime fresh aroma make thik product attractive. In this pandamic Situation this Product is Value of money Product. I got this Product at Rs. 315/-  where the printing price is Rs. 347/-The delivery was little bit slow, I have no issues in it, Finally I would like to say thank you Amazon and its whole entire team.

1,"First i thought its a Great value in such low price,but after using it i realised it a fake one guys. The product is diluted. Better to give some more money and buy the real product rather than saving money and getting a fake one!"
5,"Original Product with good packaging, longer expiry date and less price than usual MRP. A must buy product for every household. Got it at 151/- Rs."
5,"Dettols quality is the best. However, in value, it is available on Amazon only on MRP. But in general the 1.5 liter refill pack is not available in the market. So if you are a Amazon Prime member then you can buy it"
1,"Got empty sooner than expected lol. But good.stuffEdit: this time there was a problem. After half the pack was empty, the liquid is totally rubbish. It doesnt lather at all !The liquid at the bottom smelled like phenylRealised this is fake  tampered package.When will India ever be free of this malpractice and adultery !Very disappointed. Wont buy again"
1,"Its dilutated. I ignored the comments that said the product is fake, but after I received the product I noticed colour of the soap is lighter than the soap that I bought from the local store and the soap is watery ke less viscous. Being a student I thought this will be value for money kinda deak but this is a fake product and the seller is looting customers"
5,Great deal and good packaging.  Packaging so impressive.  Words are too short for defining.  Thanks Amazon
1,"The seal of the cap was opened when received.Also, the quantity seem to be less than actually written on the product as seal was opened."
1,Seal was brokenAnd totally damaged packet..
1,You might think you would buy a refill instead of a new bottle to save money or even reduce plastic use.However do not buy this refill. It is not the original dettol handwash.As soon as i refilled bottle and started using i noticed first color is lighter. Noticeably lighter. Then i noticed that the scent is very faint compared to original one from bottle.I ignored it because in times like these you cant be picky.Then two days later i noticed my skin peeling off like it never has before. I have used handwash for a long time it has never happened to me.I wouldnt even risk givin this pack away to someone for free because it is awful. So it will end up in dustbin.
3,"The product packaging was good. Inside the package, you get one 1500ml dettol liquid handwash.Now, there is one thing Im extremely upset about which is that the liquid seems diluted. Its like someone mixed water in it. It doesnt feel like dettol at all. Im not saying that it is fake or not but thats what I got. About the scent, its not very strong. Its value for money only if you get it at good discount. I got it for 188rs.Anyways, if you find this review ""Helpful"" please do let me know. Thank you."

4,More of an air freshener and smells good
4,"I have two small kids at home and they are continuously falling ill these days. So, I bought Dettol disinfected spray last week and very much satisfied with it. It has a very nice and mild scented fragrance. I tried it inside my car, washroom and kids room as well. It leaves the place very fresh and nice.Although, there is no way to check whether it kills the germs or not but still I think it worth to try once. All the freshners, which I had tried before, came with very hard scented and irritating smell. But this is very mild and soothing.One should give it a try for sure as it is pocket friendly too."
5,Was looking for a good disinfectant spray as I have toddlers and keeping them safe from flu and virus is really tough. So while browsing Dettol caught my eye and without a second thought got it. It has mild scent and really easy to use. It evaporates in 15-20 seconds and so saves time. I Use it when I go out especially in public toilets. So convenient and travel friendly. Will definitely recommend.
1,Alcohol content is only 57% whereas I was given to understand its 72% . The Amazon listing does not mention alcohol content which is very important as anything less than 60% is ineffective to kill viruses like Covid -19 . Ideally should be 70% alcohol for it to be totally effective
3,I have orderd two spray bottle and recieved only one cap. One spray os with cap and one without. Smell is also not so good.
2,Received unsealed cans. Cap fell off easily  nozzle was unsealed. Raises doubt how a brand like dettol can sell unsealed items. Not sure if original.The sprayer design is also different from my earlier purchases. Earlier the item had a nice hooded spray mechanism without cap. This one is a regular type like with cap (similar to perfumes  savlon spray)
1,I ordered this product because of Covid19. But used it after 2 weeks and found that this will kill you as well. After you spray it will get into your respiratory system and you wont be able to breath. The smell is very harsh. It suffocates you. I followed there guidelines and wore mask while spraying on items. But the spray will remain in air for a while and you will inhale it. It took 1 hour for me to come to my normal breathing. This was my personal experience. I wont suggest this product to any one. Please do not buy this product
5,"Be 100% sure, when you use a dettol products. Far better from others spray present in the market now.New improved container spray with a pleasent fragrance. Carry it inside your bag and stay safe."
5,"I used this product first time and Im very much satisfied with this multi-purpose disinfectant spray that kills bacteria and viruses by eliminating odour causing bacteria . We can use this product in bedroom , toilet , kitchen , mattress etc . I recommend this product because it is very hygienic  and it also gives pleasant fragrance after every use."
4,"Dettol Surface Disinfectant Spray is good  for killing germs. But few points are worth noting.1. New spray bottle comes with a cap, whereas old bottle comes without cap, which is discontinued by dettol.2. Most of the material inside is gas, very less quantity of alcohol.3. New spray pump has very less spray power(too weak) when compared to old one.4. Dettol is widely used by people inspite of the fact that it comes with 60% alcohol, whereas other brands like savlon comes with 62% alcohol.5. Fragrance is strong.6. Cap is not properly fitted and comes off very easily."

5,Savlon liquid is a must for home. It is far better than so called Dettol as savlon has CHG and cetrimide. It has better efficacy against germs but the advertisement by HUL have made people sick so they buy dettol.It doesnt burn skin when applied on cuts / wound. Better smell. Also an Indian Product.
5,"Much better than dettol, doesnt burn, Doctor has recommended this over dettol anyway. Use it multiple ways - regular use of cuts and bruises, use it to add to floor wash bucket and other cleaning needs."
5,Much needed product during this pandemic
5,"Was waiting for a long long time to get my hands on this post pandemic. Its still very difficult to find in local stores or any other online shops and finally its now available on Amazon.Extreme useful and versatile liquid to have at home which can be used for first aids, bathing, shaving, disinfecting clothes or even for floor cleaning. Do dilute the liquid as per the instructions mentioned on the product label.It contains Chlorhexidine Gluconate Solution I. P. 1.5% v/v and strong Cetrimide Solution B.P. equivalent to Cetrimide I.P. 3.0% w/v to provide antiseptic and disinfectant properties. This duo not only more effective than Dettols (Original Brown liquid) Chloroxylenol but also doesnt sting after applying on skin.Theres also now a Multipurpose Disinfectant cleaner from Savlon to compete against Dettols Multipurpose Liquid (Green, Blue bottle) which is more suitable as disinfectant if you want nice fragrance but also a lot more expensive  https://www.amazon.in/dp/B08CL5P72J/, stick to this Original Savlon if you dont want much fragrance."
5,Best but price is on mrp  no discount
5,"Product is aqurate, original, recently manufacture. Seal is ok, good condition, good packaging. Completely satisfied."
5,"Savlon is the modern antiseptic. It has a no burn formula. I use it everywhere. On clothes, in the floor cleanser and add to the bathing water . Great to see it in Amazon."
4,"I gave this a try as dettol antiseptic was not available. Not sure about effectiveness. But unlike dettol, water turns orange in colour upon using savlon and cant be used for laundry especially for white clothes. It doesnt stain clothes but gives a very mild peachy tint. Coming to scent, i read some reviews where it was mentioned that smell is better than dettol. But i  dont feel the difference.  In fact i prefer dettol smell, may be because we were using it since long.."
2,"I have doubt, is this original or duplicate product..May b duplicate one..."
1,"Smells like strong chemical, not at all a pleasant smell as some reviews say. We used it for a nappy wash for our baby and the only thing happening is getting an orange colour share on the dress. This has a bad smell if you think Dettols smell is bad, then this is horrible. There is no need to buy a product only because it is made by an Indian company. You may see this pattern on positive comments do not get tricked with it."

5,"Dettol soaps are very nice and it contains antibacterial properties and antiseptic properties which kills bacteria. Dettol soaps are available in many fragrance. which are very nice to use. When we take bath with ""Dettol""soaps our skin feels refreshed.  Dettol sops are especially made for kiling bacteria present on our skin.

Thank you for reading my review. I hope it may help you to make a best choice."
5,The quality of the product is very good. Buying dettol soap in a special offer on Amazon is always beneficial
5,"This soap is really hard to find, unless you live in certain parts where you can find it. I love the antibacterial properties of the soap it keeps my skin really clean in the summer and it works wonders for people like myself who are suffering from Hidradenitis. The smell can be a bit off putting (it basically smells like Pine-Sol) but it doesnt linger on your skin. Definetly worth a try!"
5,"to be honest, I bought this here because it was out of stock at shops near my area..Thanks to Amazon I found it with a one-day-delivery.. good packaging..- been using Dettol for many years now, good at germ protection.. great soap..- Dettol is always good, let it be the soap or liquid hand wash..- happy with the product.."

2,Less useful product.instead buy dettol original and add to water in which clothes are soaked.waste of money
1,Bottle was not sealed. Not expected this from such a big brand. May b its fake product
2,"All we go for a brand like dettol, but if it isnt sealed, then its no better to prefer one....first time usage with this particular product type from Dettol, not sure whether if it is sealed or NO from the manufacuturer, would recommend it be sealed from the manufacturer for it is directly depandant on our satisfaction."
3,Dettol antiseptic liquid original is far better in all terms rather than this product. Not helpful in removing odors
2,Out of two bottles one bottle is unsealed . I don’t understand how it is opened before delivery please  answer my quire 1st is sealed 2nd is already opened
5,"Fantastic product, must have as essentials now .. leaves a good frangrance on clothes and ofcourse hygeine wise plys marks"
5,Why this product isnt seal packed. I have ordered twice but both time it came open. What if the quality is compromised.
5,"Works well , leaves good smell, slightly overpriced"
1,The product was not in sealed condition and I feel it is adulterated also

5,Already using dettol lime fresh (green) from its launch which is a great product but this menthol cool (blue) is best
5,"Very effective. Active ingredients are  quaternary ammonium chloride compounds which are a very potent and effective disinfectant - you can find these in most non-bleach disinfectant solutions. This is not the same as Dettol antiseptic used for skin so do not use it for that purpose. I am glad that Dettol introduced this as it was difficult to find purpose-made disinfectant concentrates of this formulation - the alternative was Amway Pursue which is not only much more expensive but would involve the hassle of dealing with a pushy Amway salesperson. Anyways, this one has a strong menthol smell and a highly effective disinfectant so fantastic for household use. Also works for laundry, but use it as a pre-wash, with a full wash cycle afterwards to clean out any residues.Also, a word of caution with this and any other disinfectants - please use it wisely and not indiscriminately as overuse not only can damage the environment but kill of beneficial microorganisms and cause harmful ones to develop resistance."
5,"This is one of the best disinfectant I have ever used. It has a strong menthol smell which I just love. This is a multipurpose liquid ,which can be used to clean laundry, wipe the floor, used while shaving to cleanse the razor, kitchen and bathroom cleaning, can be added to bathing water while taking a bath (those who dont mind menthol smell). Mind you, this is not the good old detail antiseptic liquid which comes with the clear bottle and green cap,which  is handy for cuts and wounds. This is an disinfectant liquid used for household cleaning. I use this in the washing machine along with the normal liquid detergent and let me tell you,my clothes smell amazing after wash.  I would recommend you all to try this if you like strong menthol smell. I just love it.. 5 stars for the product."
5,"Best for during this hot day and pain in ass corona virus. If  Want to feel fresh , add this on and take bath. Perfect to maintain ur  hygiene And feel fresh during this summer. Stay safe"
5,I am juz happy to tey this out. It has strong mint flavour with sweet essence balanced for my usage in bathroom. Stays perfectly long for washroom and bathroom specially places which are more closed and secluded. Its essense could be felt after 12 hrs also. Trust me. I seldomly rate anyone. Its a good for my daily usages. A change from orignal 30 years old flavour :-) try it.
5,Pretty cool and innovative stuff from Dettol. The minty flavor and then it gives tingling effects on the body.Its usually expensive than the lemon one but I suggest buy it when Amazon gives Especially Cloudtail India offers discount.  They are just amazing. You name it. They have it.Back to the product. That cool sensation with antiseptic is a must try and must buy.
5,This is a nice and innovative product from Reckitt Benckiser. Amazon deserves thanks because this is not available in local medicine shops. Those who are complaining that this is not as strong as the original Dettol Antiseptic Liquid are comparing apples and oranges. This scented Dettol Disinfectant Liquid is ideal for baths and imparting a freshness to just washed clothes.
5,"Supply water in Delhi has foul smell, this liquid certainly makes that smell gone! Plus killing the germs!I use it daily for bathing and washing clothes too!Online deal is good as I bought this at discounted price!"
5,Every household needs Dettol products and especially those which have kids around.This new Dettol disinfectant with menthol fragrance leaves a fresh feeling and smell in your entire house when used along with cleaning water!Recommended for cleaning and washing.
5,"Now I have tried all variants of dettol liquids and putting aside the added benefits of the antiseptic version, this one is the best among them. One capfull in a bucket of water and you will have the freshest of baths. Scent not as strong as antiseptic, but quite good. Recieved sealed bottle and next day delivery for prime and mfg date is the same month of order date, so really happy with the purchase."
5,Already using dettol lime fresh (green) from its launch which is a great product but this menthol cool (blue) is best
5,"Very effective. Active ingredients are  quaternary ammonium chloride compounds which are a very potent and effective disinfectant - you can find these in most non-bleach disinfectant solutions. This is not the same as Dettol antiseptic used for skin so do not use it for that purpose. I am glad that Dettol introduced this as it was difficult to find purpose-made disinfectant concentrates of this formulation - the alternative was Amway Pursue which is not only much more expensive but would involve the hassle of dealing with a pushy Amway salesperson. Anyways, this one has a strong menthol smell and a highly effective disinfectant so fantastic for household use. Also works for laundry, but use it as a pre-wash, with a full wash cycle afterwards to clean out any residues.Also, a word of caution with this and any other disinfectants - please use it wisely and not indiscriminately as overuse not only can damage the environment but kill of beneficial microorganisms and cause harmful ones to develop resistance."
5,"This is one of the best disinfectant I have ever used. It has a strong menthol smell which I just love. This is a multipurpose liquid ,which can be used to clean laundry, wipe the floor, used while shaving to cleanse the razor, kitchen and bathroom cleaning, can be added to bathing water while taking a bath (those who dont mind menthol smell). Mind you, this is not the good old detail antiseptic liquid which comes with the clear bottle and green cap,which  is handy for cuts and wounds.

5,"Highest TFM content grade 1 soap. Recommended by the doctors.Though Nivea launched its own soap flagship in india few days back which is in fact might have beaten cinthol in terms of quality.But for the price range,cinthol is the best.The quality of the soap is determined by its TFM content which is almost same in nivea and cinthol but nivea also moisturizes the skin from within along with the cleansing.Anyways,both are the best soaps available in the market just with a little price differences.Please dont use soaps like pears and all,they are fooling the indian customers with lowest tfm content.Google it for more info!"

5,Fragrance is really freshening. Aroma could be felt even before opening the parcel. Got at ₹165.
5,I prefer cinthol soap amongst all the soaps available. Its fragrance is very good. This product Cinthol Cool is so good. I have already used it thats why I ordered a pack of 8 Cinthol Cool soaps. Packaging is good and all the soaps are in good condition. You can also try Cinthol Confidence + soap.
4,"Theres nothing extraordinary in this soap.. dont expect much for its ""cool"" name tag..I didnt feel anything ""cool"" while using this soap..overall not that bad but also not that good.. fragrance is avg(to me).."
1,"I have used different variants of cinthol but this one highly disappointed me. On the scale of 10 fragrance 2/10, Cooling effect 3/10 It melts very easily. I am not sure if it is original or not. I have stopped using this soap...I dont know what to do with the rest of them...."
5,For Summers its just great... Feels cool cool... And yeah fragnace lasts for long enough. Using for past 2years.
5,It comes with a mild fragrance which keeps you nd your body refresh.  Best of cinthol from all the other varieties of soap.
4,i felt a burn at eyebrows most of the face wash cool and pefume is awesome got 165 for 8 on amazon offer
5,Very nice product.
3,Durable perfume...Nice scent

5,"What a gem from an old and trusted Indian brand. And such great value for money.The fragrance is nice powdery scent which is refreshing without being overpowering. The soap’s cleansing is good, not great. But it has a nice creaminess which is far beyond its modest price. In fact, it has a nice natural creaminess, and not the slipperiness of a Dove. Also, it seems to long last. A clear winner and will be a regular feature on my bathing rack."
3,"I liked the quality of the soap as it wasnt getting too chunky even if it stays wet for most part of the day. BUT, the DEO fragrance in body after taking bath with this soap *** All those are just marketing GIMMICKS. Its got no great fragrance than other soaps and actually its just too minimal. Anyhow the product feels like of good quality."
5,"I really had liked the packing of this soap. But more than that, I remember as soon as I had unpacked it, the surprising fresh smell coming from it was amazing.The soap foam feels soft, rich and white. It moisturizes the skin perfectly. I have an oily skin so I wanted a soap which can balance the skin moisture, not over moisturizing not drying out the skin. And this soap pretty much does that.Also, it lasts for a good time, also most soaps give up their foaming capability as soon as they become small, but this one still gives great lather. Would recommend to everyone."
5,Nice smelling scented bath soap from Cinthol. The scent lingers for a while even after washing off and leaves the bathroom also smelling great. Besides that it does its job of cleaning as it should. So full points there. Only thing is I was somewhat misguided and ordered a smaller pack when I needed a larger one.
5,Nice quality product. Great product. Buying all the product from Amazon Pantry regularly.Thank you Amazon for such great quality products at such an affordable rate.
3,I thought the product might be black or charcoal colour but its a regular white one. The scent is not that great and didnt feel any difference btw normal average soap and this one. I feel the lime one is better than this. Its just a good marketing and nothing else.
1,I placed order 4+1 soaps.But I have received without seal pack with 4 Nos soaps only. Now how can get remaining soap.
3,"The soap is ok for bathing, no scent at all, more drier. The green one from cinthol is much better."
5,For a long time I was searching for Indian soap equal to USA Ivory soap or the soap you get in Holiday Inn Hotels. Here it is!!!! Thank you Cinthol!
5,"While the discount was only Rs 7, I have no complaints as Amazon delivered this in peak Covid-19. Thank you to the delivery person. Soap is tried and tested and one of the best available in India for summer season with the DEO."

2,"After blindly using this soap for *years* it suddenly struck me that there is zero cooling effect in this soap now and by now I mean 2-3 years.I started using cinthol cool 6-7 years ago as a kid when I used to think how awesome is this soap (with that tingling cooling after sensation) I felt that this soap is way underrated because of that and the signature smell of it. But now I have realised that the cooling part is ZERO. And the fragrance is bland and doesnt last long.Either this soap is fake because Ive been continuously ordering this soap online in saver pack of 4/5 soaps from Amazon (but the seller being a trusty one at that 🤔) or Godrej has changed the chemical composition of this soap.Either Godrej should bring a ""stronger"" version of cinthol cool soap or I should look for better alternatives because this soap isnt what it used to be once."
4,"I bought this product because I was experiencing some bad prickly heat and thought the menthol would help. Although I dont feel the minty feeling I was hoping for, I am still well pleased. The scent is very nice and refreshing but not over-bearing like it should only be used by MALES, not medicinal smelling. I dont feel as though my skin is dry and cracking off. And the prickly heat symptoms are gone. I like this product, I will be suggesting it to my friends and family."
1,"ONE OF THE WORST PRODUCTS WHICH I RECEIVED. THIS CINTHOL BATH COOL SOAP HAS NO FRAGRANCE, NO COOL EFFECTS AT ALL. SHOULD NOT PURCHASED BY ANYBODY. THE PACKET IS SHOWING THE DATE IS 01.2020. BUT I THINK IT MUCH MUCH OLDER DUE TO ITS NO FRAGRANCE. I CANNOT RETURN IT BECAUSE I AM TRYING TO USE ONE OF THIS."
1,"In television advertisement, the color of the soap is shown as transparent as glass.But when I bought it, the color of the soap was in blue shade.I had to buy around 5 soaps.This is totally a cheating experience by the manufacturer.Did not expect such a fraud experience."
4,Decent Soap. Very fresh and nice. Gives good amount of lather. But not the best flavor of Cinthol according to me. I like other flavors better. Cinthol is my fav soap. 
1,Has absolutely no perfume at all... and it is blue in colour not transparent from as it is shown in Cinthol Ad.Total waste
1,"This soap fluxes so fast even when you put it in a separate soap case and when you apply that melted soap, some part of it is stuck on your body specially on chest region and if you have large chest hair it will trouble you later."
1,I have ordered 4+1=5 pcs cinthol soapBut I have received only 4 pcs Shop1 pcs shop is missing in my order
5,Verry good
5,My wife likes it. She has been using this brand of soap for years. Not much else to say. It’s a bar of soap.
2,"After blindly using this soap for *years* it suddenly struck me that there is zero cooling effect in this soap now and by now I mean 2-3 years.I started using cinthol cool 6-7 years ago as a kid when I used to think how awesome is this soap (with that tingling cooling after sensation) I felt that this soap is way underrated because of that and the signature smell of it. But now I have realised that the cooling part is ZERO. And the fragrance is bland and doesnt last long.Either this soap is fake because Ive been continuously ordering this soap online in saver pack of 4/5 soaps from Amazon (but the seller being a trusty one at that 🤔) or Godrej has changed the chemical composition of this soap.Either Godrej should bring a ""stronger"" version of cinthol cool soap or I should look for better alternatives because this soap isnt what it used to be once."
4,"I bought this product because I was experiencing some bad prickly heat and thought the menthol would help. Although I dont feel the minty feeling I was hoping for, I am still well pleased. The scent is very nice and refreshing but not over-bearing like it should only be used by MALES, not medicinal smelling. I dont feel as though my skin is dry and cracking off. And the prickly heat symptoms are gone. I like this product, I will be suggesting it to my friends and family."
1,"ONE OF THE WORST PRODUCTS WHICH I RECEIVED. THIS CINTHOL BATH COOL SOAP HAS NO FRAGRANCE, NO COOL EFFECTS AT ALL. SHOULD NOT PURCHASED BY ANYBODY. THE PACKET IS SHOWING THE DATE IS 01.2020. BUT I THINK IT MUCH MUCH OLDER DUE TO ITS NO FRAGRANCE. I CANNOT RETURN IT BECAUSE I AM TRYING TO USE ONE OF THIS."
1,"In television advertisement, the color of the soap is shown as transparent as glass.But when I bought it, the color of the soap was in blue shade.I had to buy around 5 soaps.This is totally a cheating experience by the manufacturer.Did not expect such a fraud experience."

1,"Its cheating under broad day light, I bought the biscuit to see its mrp itself is RS 20. There is no discount, or you may think its a combo pack. Its just a 100grm packet."
1,All time biskits are broken.
3,"FLAVOR WAS GOOD, TASTE TOO BUT MOST OF THE BISCUITS IN THE PACK WERE BROKEN .THIS IS DUE TO POOR HANDLING AND TRANSPORT BY THE SUPPLIER I SUPPOSE"
4,Good
2,Biscuits are always broken inside the packet. Is damaged product sold here? Got it at 16 on other portal every time I buy it and it was not damaged from within. Bought from g o mart.
5,The size of the biscuits for the price is a joke. Taste is not good.
5,Hi .. Great taste  and found too good for grandparents. I m sure they will like it...
1,This product tastes like saw dust

5,One of the standard biscuits of our and our previous generation. Nothing much to write about this though. Buy it and eat it for better understanding of this. Ting ting ti ting 🤣
1,These have become a joke so small in size and hardly any product in terms of heft. The package had a whole in them had to bin these as came part of our Pantry order and couldnt be bothered to follow up with the redundant customer care.
1,Most of the biscuits were crushed.Had to throw half of the biscuit dusts. So a total loss .i bought it from amazon prime. Unhappy with my purchase
1,Kachha maida (uncooked wheat flour) tastes better than this. Go for their Vita Marie variant instead.
5,Brand Britannia no thing to introduce for biscuit quality.
1,"It is surprisingly different taste and flavor which is basically dust and soil taste and unable to eatable , really very bad taste in 1st time of this biscuit"

5,Best biscuits of choice for early morning coffee or tea snack companion. Since these are high in fiber they have even helped me a lot in providing relief from constipation problems due to my prior poor diet choices. It took me at-least a weeks time to see significant changes. I am happy for now and would definitely recommend these biscuits for people suffering from these kind of ailments as an food of choice instead of medications.
5,Healthy and tasty both
5,This is a good productAnd safely delivered
5,"Though a bit pricey but worth it, healthy and tasty"
1,taste is terrible

1,This is not the same product as advertised. I received a Steax Vitariche gloss serum instead of Streax pro Vitagloss as the product name suggests. Called CS to get the refund and since i had closed my bank account since the order was placed i wanted the refund to come through amazon pay. However Amazon rep Aniket and the supervisor Krishna were absolutely unhelpful and went against common sense to keep telling me that the refund will only be processed to the closed bank account and the bank will issue me a DD. When i called them out on their lack of common sense they kept repeating themselves. Finally decided to give away the product than to deal with Amazon for a refund. This shows how base Amazon’s customer service is and a good sign for all to avoid using Amazon if you value your money and time.
5,"No doubt, product is awesome and available at very reasonable price in comparison to other serums and even better than those.But Amazon or Streax, can you tell me how to extract it without its upper cap??Obviously, It may be a fault either by Manufacturing Company or Amazon while packaging.But overall, I am not finding a solution that how to popup serum out of the bottle?"
5,Best serum ....smell is toooo good...I realy liked a lott...just take a small quatity f serum and aply al over the hair before u go fr straighten...as per the description it realy protect the hair from damage...thumbs up fr the product
5,Minimal effort required to tame frizzy hair with this serum. Hair has nice shiny smooth look and soft to touch. Pleasant scent. Has same good effect on damp hair as well as completely dried hair. Overall thumbs up for this product.
5,"Ive used this serum on my normal hair and chemically straightened hair, as well as seen results on colored hair. And honestly at this price, it never disappointed me. Though the texture is quite thin compared to a lot of other hair serums, but I like how it does not feel heavy on my hair and just a pump of it is enough to dab on my medium length hair. This does the basic job of a hair serum from detangling to providing moisture to the ends of the hair and since it goes a long way, so thumbs up from my side. And to my surprise, the new variant - vitariche gloss is way better than the previous one and this comes with nutty fragrance, which I totally love!"
1,"In the package the product did not have a cap as shown in the picture and naturally it was leaking in the box. and I can not be sure of the originality of the same!This item is not returnable by policy, which is understood by nature of the product. But in these cases there should be option to return damaged product. Had bought the item from cloudtail so do expect better experience."
5,It actually provides a very shiny effect while protecting your hair.And it leaves them with a very pleasant fragrance  
5,"I’ve been using this serum for past couple of years and have purchased it for the sixth time recently so was forced to drop a comment automatically. This is the best serum available for the purpose. I’ve got thick hair so before applying wax or blow drying, I need something to protect them and it serves the purpose really well."
5,"Worth its price. Make hair soft and silky and last more than 2 days.The way I discovered this was I had applied this after bath to get ready for a function, it gives a finishing shine to my hairs. Next day as well I don’t need to put extra serum.Amazon delivered this product without any leakage/spills whatsoever... thank you Amazon ans the seller."

4,"Someone like me had always fancied upon getting some of my hair getting coloured when I see some people with colored or highlighted hair.Going to parlor or salon has always been hard on budget if you are living in a working middle class family.Finally I decided to get 2 packets of this hair highlighter after doing some research and surfing various Youtube videos.Coming to this product let me review as under:Pros:1  Gives good color/highlights if kept for about 45 minutes. (note: 30 minutes is not enough if you have dark black hair).2 The color stays for about 8-9 months and lightens with time.3 After about 1-1.5 months of applying this hair color, I would suggest to use henna/mehendi for about 1 hour in all you hairs...which will not only nourish your hair, but also give very good result for highlighted hairs.4 Personal tip- If you are not satisfied with colored/highlighted hair and want to remove it, use anti-dandruff shampoo 3-4 times while washing your hair. Also the Godrej hair dye (black) available in powder sachet is also effective in removing the highlights.Cons:1 One sachet is not enough even for short hair. Purchase 2 sachets if you want proper results. (note: if you are a girl with shoulder length hair or more, I would suggest 3 sachets).2 Does not give too much highlighted effect if you want to get noticed from others with normal hair.3 Just like any other chemical hair color, it damages you hair and makes your hair rough.Verdict:It is ok to give this a try once if you want to color/highlight your hair at home. I would rather suggest spending few bucks and get your hair highlighted in parlor or salon for better results.If you find my review helpful, please click the YES/HELPFUL button! "
5,"Best hair highlighter!  Loved it. Perfect for brown hair girls!  It stays for a long time. No damage, no dullness or frizzy hair.. The conditioner provided by streax is just awesome.. Makes your hair colour look more glossy and shiny. Smoothed out the hair.."
5,Im looking like tigress.  I love it.  
5,You don’t need to pay extra in salons when u have this. I just love this colour. But if you have long hair then you need two packets of this as such the quantity is less. Other than you can see everything in the picture. I just love the way it turned out.
5,"Very nice product,,, easy too use with gud colout"
2,"This color is not for highlighting natural hair. It can highlight only bleached hair. And this kit does not contain blond powder to bleach the hair. It contains only developer and color. I applied it and it didnt give me any visible result on my natural hair, although it can be seen in sunlight. But I didnt get the color I desired."
5,"Did It my on  ends, gives  beautiful  colour  used style 1 n 2 both 1  is brown ( lesser time)  to orangish  if  kept  fr  long and 2  is orange  to golden. U can experience storbing  at home  with  it at cheap  rate with great  results.. Use it  with Britt or simply  wherever u want  with gloved ✋  N it doesnt  damge  hair  just  takecare that  u oil  or  spa  it regularly as lighter hair  tends to look rough.  Go for it ,follow instructions given  for usage..change  ur look  in Mts."
1,"Its a nightmare!!!!!!Trust me, I stuck to each and every direction written on the leaflet, and after almost 2 hours of blonder-shampoo-color-shampoo routine, my entire hair turned orange!!!! That too, not a funky orange. Just the badly-done-henna orange, if you know what I mean.I have tried blue and green and blonde hair color previously, semi+permanent and permanent, but never did I think that a safe color like cappucino brown will turn out to be such a disaster!!!!!!!!Had to order another color just to cover this mess up. Frantically searching for scarfs andhats right now."

5,"Best hair highlighter!  Loved it. Perfect for brown hair girls!  It stays for a long time. No damage, no dullness or frizzy hair.. The conditioner provided by streax is just awesome.. Makes your hair colour look more glossy and shiny. Smoothed out the hair.."
5,Im looking like tigress.  I love it.  
5,You don’t need to pay extra in salons when u have this. I just love this colour. But if you have long hair then you need two packets of this as such the quantity is less. Other than you can see everything in the picture. I just love the way it turned out.
5,"Very nice product,,, easy too use with gud colout"
2,"This color is not for highlighting natural hair. It can highlight only bleached hair. And this kit does not contain blond powder to bleach the hair. It contains only developer and color. I applied it and it didnt give me any visible result on my natural hair, although it can be seen in sunlight. But I didnt get the color I desired."
5,"Did It my on  ends, gives  beautiful  colour  used style 1 n 2 both 1  is brown ( lesser time)  to orangish  if  kept  fr  long and 2  is orange  to golden. U can experience storbing  at home  with  it at cheap  rate with great  results.. Use it  with Britt or simply  wherever u want  with gloved ✋  N it doesnt  damge  hair  just  takecare that  u oil  or  spa  it regularly as lighter hair  tends to look rough.  Go for it ,follow instructions given  for usage..change  ur look  in Mts."
1,"Its a nightmare!!!!!!Trust me, I stuck to each and every direction written on the leaflet, and after almost 2 hours of blonder-shampoo-color-shampoo routine, my entire hair turned orange!!!! That too, not a funky orange. Just the badly-done-henna orange, if you know what I mean.I have tried blue and green and blonde hair color previously, semi+permanent and permanent, but never did I think that a safe color like cappucino brown will turn out to be such a disaster!!!!!!!!Had to order another color just to cover this mess up. Frantically searching for scarfs andhats right now."
2,"Product is good , but the final color is not it must be , it is reddish color"
4,"Overall Streax Ultralights Hair Color in Style 2 is an extremely affordable and easy to use at home, complete hair highlighting kit. On colored hair it adds a vibrant shade ranging from light brown to golden without causing any hair damage."
4,"Someone like me had always fancied upon getting some of my hair getting coloured when I see some people with colored or highlighted hair.Going to parlor or salon has always been hard on budget if you are living in a working middle class family.Finally I decided to get 2 packets of this hair highlighter after doing some research and surfing various Youtube videos.Coming to this product let me review as under:Pros:1  Gives good color/highlights if kept for about 45 minutes. (note: 30 minutes is not enough if you have dark black hair).2 The color stays for about 8-9 months and lightens with time.3 After about 1-1.5 months of applying this hair color, I would suggest to use henna/mehendi for about 1 hour in all you hairs...which will not only nourish your hair, but also give very good result for highlighted hairs.4 Personal tip- If you are not satisfied with colored/highlighted hair and want to remove it, use anti-dandruff shampoo 3-4 times while washing your hair. Also the Godrej hair dye (black) available in powder sachet is also effective in removing the highlights.Cons:1 One sachet is not enough even for short hair. Purchase 2 sachets if you want proper results. (note: if you are a girl with shoulder length hair or more, I would suggest 3 sachets).2 Does not give too much highlighted effect if you want to get noticed from others with normal hair.3 Just like any other chemical hair color, it damages you hair and makes your hair rough.Verdict:It is ok to give this a try once if you want to color/highlight your hair at home.

2,"Gurl, dont buy this if you dont want to bleach your hair. My hair used to be a really dark brown, so its black now. Not even a tint of purple. Hair dyes normally dont show up dark hair naturally. You either bleach your hair and lie it die or use a REALLY BRIGHT HAIR DYE AND PRAY FOR THE HAIR LORDS TO BLESS YOUR FACE."
4,Dont know for how long it will stay colour is nice only if used on properly bleached hair else wont be visible. Streax other items are not that highly priced its reasonable unlike this one. For this tubr 300 is fine.
5,"Absolutely perfect product, delivers exactly as described. No flaws. Very pleasant smell and works like a wonder. Just follow instructions exactly. And do lighten hair with bleach.Advice- do wear gloves as volume will stain skin.Small criticism- bottle had little less product to colour all my hair as I have quite thick and long hair. But can easily get two bottles and it’s perfect"
5,Its a very rich purple. More red hued but does its work.Semi permanentI really disliked its smell.Very strong!
5,"I love the longetivity of this product , this is the only purple I could find out of every semi permanent dyes out there.This is my first time using this product and it turned out really pretty , but I had to bleach my hair twice and it is very important to bleach your hair to level 8 or above (total blonde) ..do not dilute the colour and always take 1:2 ratio of blonder and developer to get the best results"
5,"Ive been trying to get purple hair since so long! Wanted to get rid of green hair without bleach washing and directly applied the purple dye over the green hair. I was really surprised when the colour turned out the way I wanted!Really great quality and quantity for 450 rs. Very happy with the purchase! The smell is a bit strong, but pleasant. More red undertones than blue."
1,Doesnt work without bleach ....why are u selling a colour without bleach then include it ...too much high price
4,The product colour doesnt stay for a long time.Need to apply every 2weeks once.Rather than that no other flaws. The colour is vibrant. Need to Bleach your hair before using it.
5,Nice purple. Doesn’t stay for too long. Pretty good. Colored extremely dark hair. Buy hair bleach and developer with it.

5,I have never used any hair color before but for my white hairs my husband has recommended me streax hair color. its soft gel composition allow colour to spread easily. It is mild  gentle on the hair.now I say it is just awesome.After using this my hair has become very soft and color also looks very natural...
1,Insufficient quantity of developer..... Neither do they replace it nor do they take any action.....I do not think anyone should buy it as there is no effect without this developer
4,I liked this product a lot. Color comes out to be so natural looking. I told my friends too to use the same.
5,Best quality done first time colour happy to use best streax..well its rightly said color b care b.. amazing shiny hair
4,Nice product
5,Perfect gel formula..No cream base like in all other colors for example garnier.. I m using it from 4 years.. Easily stays for 25 days..whether u use harsh shmpoo or mild..whether hot water ir cold..perfect color
1,"Tempered product..seal was broken in the developer bottle,shampoo and conditioner..Even ""SHAMPOO""was just oil.. Disappointed.!!!"
3,Its like other color like Garnier at very high price
1,"Not suitable , for scalp dandruff will come"
5,Highly recommended

5,"The blue came out great! I have dark brown hair and bleached it twice (with volume 30 developer) before applying the colour. Left the colour on for 45-60 minutes. My hair (which felt very rough after bleaching) became much softer after rinsing off the colour. I also used the Crazy Violet (can see it in the pic). Have previously used Manic Panic hair colour which is 4 times the price, and a lot less effective. Would definitely recommend this range from Streax :D"
5,"Very vibrant colour and fade away after a monthl , perfect electric blue ,but you have to bleach your hair twice before applying itIt works on atleast level 10 hair "
4,"Came out a beautiful colour on my level 9 hair even though I diluted it with conditioner to increase the quantity. Wouldve been stunning if I didnt have to do that! Try to increase the time between washes as you can noticeably see it fade after every wash. Give your hair a blast of cold water after showering to lock the cuticle or the colour will bleed over your neck, clothes, everywhere until it dries."
4,It gives this color on lifting your black hair to level 5-6..I guess the streax gems collection is much better than this single tube color

3,"Out of 2 baby powder packs I ordered, quanity of one pack is genuinely less than the other one. Its strange. Products are genuine though."
1,"This product fake,not a Himalaya ProductPlease don’t buy this powder"
1,My baby got a rash few days after i started using this. So i blame this as nothing else had changed. The texture is quite rough whoch is strange for a baby product. Using it for my own face as i dont want to throw such a big pack away
1,"I just want to inform everybody that, this product is only original from outer, Inside its duplicate product. So i want to say that dont buy this product. Very third quality product."
1,Size of the powder bottle differs ... i seriously doubt its original or duplicate. Smell of the powder is also slightly differs.i checked with the product i bought in himalayas shop. Its different.
5,Product:All the Himalaya baby products are good and at par with Johnson products with almost half the price. This baby powder is no exception. Although we are so used to that calming JJ baby smell that this smell doesnt seem like good enough. But overall the product does the job.Packaging:It need a little improvement because my package was crushed but the product was safe.Delivery:As always before. time.
1,"Received opened product. Both bottles had less quantity. I fear it may be duplicate or contaminated since it was already opened. Himalaya powder is good product, but the one received is not good. There may be problem with seller. Amazon should have some guidelines for appointing seller."
5,"Omron digital thermometer offers a safe, accurate and quick temperature reading. Am using it for last 3-4 years.  It eliminates any worries about broken glass or mercury hazards. It can be used for oral, rectal and underarm temperature measurement. 3-digit, + degree celcius (degree fahrenheit) display in 0.1 degree increment, Gives a pleasant beep when measurement is completed.  It has Auto off function, approximately 30 minutes after use or 3 minutes when not been used"

1,It contains ammonia guyz. Its very dangerous. I bought it and used it one day one the next day morning my face swelled. But my skin is smooth and its glowing but I had numerous side effects. They will sell their products but people health could completely damaged
3,Why free article not delivered/provided along product where it is clearly mentioned on bottle that  free body lotion 100ml and not for individual sale?
5,"Product is just awesome..  If u have dry skin,  then this is the right one for u...  Mine is damn dry skin and it is working just awesome unlike other face wash..  Even Himalaya neem face is not that good like aloevera one..."
5,"This is superb! I love it from the day I started using it. It works like a charm. My skin is as soft as that of a new born baby and I receive loads of compliments day in and day out for this. Thank You so much, Himalaya Herbals. A big thanks to Amazon for the lovely packing and packaging of the product as well as timely delivery. If you found my review helpful, please click on helpful and let me know. Divine Thanks. BLESSED BE!!"
1,"I regularly buy products from Amazon.in, but this was for the 1st time I had to face disappointment. Upon opening the package I found that the Himalaya  moisturizing Aloe Vera face wash was missing by half.😱"
3,Bought this product and delivered yesterday (6th Aug). Delivery and Packaging is superb as always.Regarding face wash: Suitable for dry face only. Therefore not recommended for other skin types. Kind of sticky and thus does not gives clean look.
5,Initially I thought this face wash is waste of money as it doesnt lather at all but used it for a month anyways. I have started noticing a lot of difference in my skin. This made my skin very soft n all the dry patches I had on my face have reduced as this doesnt dry your skin rather hydrate your skin along with cleaning it... Best face wash for people with sensitive n dry skin.
4,"First impression : lathers very poorly. Its like applying lotion and washing it off. But well lack of foam doesnt necessarily mean its not cleaning my skin.Second impression after washing : mmm skin does feel better,will try using it againFinal impression after using it some more : Very good . It really does moisturize your skin. Perfect for dry skin, specially in harsh winter.Ive very dry and sensitive skin so i need a very good moisturising  skin care routine specially in winter months. My sensitive skin does not agree with random products bought off the shelf. I tried this in 100ml tube as its herbal and I liked as it really does moisturize my dry skin so I bought this 200ml pack from Amazon.I removed a star though as its outlet is so big ,a very generous amount plops out in single pump and you end up finishing it up way faster as compared to other face wash( the 100ml tube had a very generous outlet too)."
4,"I loved this face wash, nice clean feel  post the use. I mostly used high end face products coz I have dry skin and what we usually get in the market is for oily skin but this is my new fav.  Well done Himalaya 🏼"

5,"Product is just awesome..  If u have dry skin,  then this is the right one for u...  Mine is damn dry skin and it is working just awesome unlike other face wash..  Even Himalaya neem face is not that good like aloevera one..."
5,"This is superb! I love it from the day I started using it. It works like a charm. My skin is as soft as that of a new born baby and I receive loads of compliments day in and day out for this. Thank You so much, Himalaya Herbals. A big thanks to Amazon for the lovely packing and packaging of the product as well as timely delivery. If you found my review helpful, please click on helpful and let me know. Divine Thanks. BLESSED BE!!"
1,"I regularly buy products from Amazon.in, but this was for the 1st time I had to face disappointment. Upon opening the package I found that the Himalaya  moisturizing Aloe Vera face wash was missing by half.😱"
3,Bought this product and delivered yesterday (6th Aug). Delivery and Packaging is superb as always.Regarding face wash: Suitable for dry face only. Therefore not recommended for other skin types. Kind of sticky and thus does not gives clean look.
5,Initially I thought this face wash is waste of money as it doesnt lather at all but used it for a month anyways. I have started noticing a lot of difference in my skin. This made my skin very soft n all the dry patches I had on my face have reduced as this doesnt dry your skin rather hydrate your skin along with cleaning it... Best face wash for people with sensitive n dry skin.
4,"First impression : lathers very poorly. Its like applying lotion and washing it off. But well lack of foam doesnt necessarily mean its not cleaning my skin.Second impression after washing : mmm skin does feel better,will try using it againFinal impression after using it some more : Very good . It really does moisturize your skin. Perfect for dry skin, specially in harsh winter.Ive very dry and sensitive skin so i need a very good moisturising  skin care routine specially in winter months. My sensitive skin does not agree with random products bought off the shelf. I tried this in 100ml tube as its herbal and I liked as it really does moisturize my dry skin so I bought this 200ml pack from Amazon.I removed a star though as its outlet is so big ,a very generous amount plops out in single pump and you end up finishing it up way faster as compared to other face wash( the 100ml tube had a very generous outlet too)."
4,"I loved this face wash, nice clean feel  post the use. I mostly used high end face products coz I have dry skin and what we usually get in the market is for oily skin but this is my new fav.  Well done Himalaya 🏼"
5,"A very good product for winters for extremely dry skin,smells gud,leaves your skin soft and supple n pea size product is enough and to be used on wet face gives a little lather,,,,,a very good facewash for this price,,,have been using from one month now."
1,"I bought 100ml pack at local shop to try it and I loved the fragrance and it leaves my baby hair smooth with a lovely lingering smell. So I ordered a 400ml pack at Amazon @Rs.168.The one I bought at local store is very thick,with almost gel like consistency, doesnt even spill out even if the cap is open and lying down,have to really squeeze it out. But the one I bought from Amazon is so watery and runny. Spills out in an instant without even squeezing bottle.There is no seal on bottle so theres no telling if the content is genuine or tampered with,maybe diluted, who knows."
5,Hai guys...!The product arrived within one of ordering so Thumsup Amazon for that.Positives-:Received a brand new product.(Mfg date-:03/18)Smells smooth and heavenlyNo skin irritation or any other allergic reactions.The strength of this shampoo was so mild.(The kid was not even crying during his bath)Cheaper than the local retail stores👉Thanks 4 reading..!👈
4,"I have been holding off on buying shampoo for my kids b/c even the ""natural"" shampoos have tons of chemicals and cause dandruff in their hair. This shampoo is wonderful - its very gentle and smells good too!Their scalps were not irritated by it so its good for sensitive skin.Very good product from amazon"
5,"Being a mom I am very peculiar about the cosmetics I use for my baby and I always try to use non chemical based cosmetics for my baby.I have tried few so called big foreign brands before but results were below average and at last tried himalaya baby shampoo and the results were just astonishing.All thr natural oil of my babies hairs were abck to normal, hairs were were soft, hardly any itching in eyes.Its a must buy products for all thr moms who love their babies.5 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 product"
5,I used this for  my own hair  and its actually good for the times when u r having trouble with ur hair and nothingsuits ur hair is falling off soits better to use something as mild as the baby shampoo! This gives shine and makes ur hair soft but dont rely on this shampoo for removing oil from ur hair this is way mild for  that !
5,"I have curly hair and am recovering from heat damage hence went natural about 3 months ago. Needed CG friendly shampoo and this one does the job.The consistency is thick like any other shampoo and it is a clear liquid. Since it is a baby shampoo, if you are an adult you may require a good 10 ml shampoo for one time use.Given the price it is worth it.  Leaves hair and scalp feeling clean."
1,There is nothing gentle about this shampoo. Himalaya does not disclose its entire ingredient list and contains methylchloroisothiazolinone which is proven to toxic. Why cheat consumers like this!
1,"From Amazon they send my package very safely so it m happy with their services but this shampoo is not suitable for adults i ordered it for myself (btw i m 20) and u cant believe how horrible its result is, actually i ordered it for decreasing my hair fall but using 1time my hair fall increase horribly and my hair became so sticky that i cant explain....i never use that shampoo after that it was just a waste of money"
3,"Dont know if just our bottle was duplicate or not, as it was discounted and my son and daughter had instant hair loss. Threw it out and reverted to Johnson and the hair loss stopped after another 2 days. Will not use this again"
5,"Great shampoo! Sulfate free, mild, soothing fragrance. Make sure you take a lot more than you usually do for it to feel sufficient. Also, rub your palms together to create a soft lather and then rub on to scalp/hair. This is important. Really useful to those with curly hair. Gentle enough for your little one."

4,Very Nice Product . It is very light weighted and quickly gets absorbed so that you dont feel  creamy when you get out using this. It gives a smooth feeling to our skin and will not irritated your skin at all. This product is a lotion and not a moisturizer so it is not a replaced for that this is baby lotion too. It works very well for your skin.As this is not an oily lotion which will not make you sweat even in hot summer It  smells  good and leaves skin smooth afterwards.  Even though this is a baby lotion people with very sensitive skin can also use this one as it is good for damaged skin too. After using for many months i can say it rebuilds your skin.Himalaya is now not using Paraben for Baby lotion so the lotion is safe than before. This lotion is not greesy at all. Please go for Original product as duplicates are out there.
4,"I bought this for myself because it came up under a search for vegan lotion. However, I will continue buying it because it is so lightweight and quickly absorbed. I live in the desert and am impressed by how much it hydrates my skin.Thank you Amazon"
5,"This is one of the best baby lotion in Market. I got this at Rs.67 only. As it is from Himalaya, I need not to write anything about quality as Himalaya products are always best in class."

Although its tad light its okay for baby skin. I love its fragrance, leaves my baby smelling nice and I use it myself too but its too light for my dry skin,but of course its meant mainly for babies.One winning feature about this particular 400ml pack is its pump feature,makes it lot easier to literally use it singlehandedly which comes in real handy if youve to hold a squirming wriggling baby with your other hand!Update : Ive ordered my 9th bottle! Initially seller give one bottle but nowadays the minimum quantity is 2 bottles. But its okay,your baby is going to use it every day and they come with very good shelf life so you finish them long before its expiry date."

Himalaya / Amazon should take note of this urgently and should check for batch no 59700545 dated Jul 2017... Take prompt action else may have to lodge legal complaint against the same.
1,"Please do not buy this product. This is an old product manufactured in 2015 when Himalaya was using Paraben based ingredients which are harmful for the babys skin. You can search the Internet for harmful effects of Paraben. Now Himalaya has removed Paraben from the newly manufactured Baby Lotion. Buy the most recent stock. The product will have ""Free from Paraben"" highlighted on the bottle. Save your babys skin by not ordering this product."

4,Happy with this product in the winter time also it gives best result for my son and yes I do malish before the bath or in night day before bath with pure cow ghee along with termaric powder and after bath I gently use this lotion. I am using both lotion and powder for him from very starting . I ordered two one for my son and another for my cousins child.
4,"Although it doesnt make your skin super soft or anything, it does a pretty good job.It gets absorbed into your skin pretty quickly with minimal effort.It also forms a protective layer until your next shower.And I like how its free from parabens and mineral oil.An ideal light weight moisturizer for non-winter months.The smell reminds me a bit of guava."
4,For Kids -3
5,"Recived the product on time thanks Amazon  Abt the product =I have been using the product a long.. It is good and come in sealed plactoc packing it has Pleasant fragrance, Thick to Medium Consistency, light on application, Easy to use bottles with nozzle / Pump.Overall m happy the usageShall be recommended P.s pic in the attachment"
1,"About that Himalaya cream, I would like to share that this product is not recent manufacturing , it is one year back manufacturing but other items are June 2019 manufacturing."
5,"I switched over from Johnson and Johnson for my son, never had any issues with Himalaya brand, be it there soap, powder or shampoo, looks like they are safe for kids."
3,Won’t suggest it to people having very dry skin like mine.Good for normal to oily skin. Gets absorbed instantly.My skin needs something greasy as it’s very dry.
5,Another amazing product from Himalaya nonsticky with lovely fragrance ... I m using it from long n  happy with it
4,The product is definitely paraben and sulphate free. However people who have very dry skin would need to apply it multiple times. Price is also quite competitive.
5,Using it from 2016 for my daughter..Her day starts with this lotion and before going to sleep she herself asks for lotion...

4,i bought this cream for my mom and ladies believe me its work great more then fancy costly  creams but yes its oily but thts ok bcs of result....i wish a serum in same series...thanx amazon ad himalaya..pls like yes if u love my review bcs its free for u.
5,"I was using Himalaya moisturized 8 years back and my skin was really good, soft and gentle. After I moved to Hyderabad I moved to different products like Olay, Ponds, Lotus, Maybelline, Lakme etc. I wasnt happy with any of them. but this Anti aging cream is awesome, in a weeks time I can see and feel the difference in my skin, its very light and light smell. Totally like this cream."
4,"I have ordered this product for my Mom. And she is very happy with the results after using this product.It does works nicely to reduce your wrinkles if you will apply it on daily bases.At least use this twice in a day, if you really want to improve your skin tone.What I liked the most about this product:#####################################Its fragrance is good.Made up with natural ingredients, So it wont harm to your skin.Comes with a very cheaper price if we will  compare to other related brands.JUST go for this product if you are suffering from wrinkle problem.####################################GO for it.Its a value for money product under budget."
3,"I got this for my mom because of the reviews and, to be honest, because of its low price. My mom has been applying it with great dedication every night for over 2 months now (had it ordered 2 times). I can’t say I have seen much of a difference. The least a cream can do is moisturize, but this cream doesn’t work as a moisturizer either. Again, I might be wrong and because my mom has just started using aging creams while she should have started at least some 10 years ago. But, I would really recommend going with better options. And people in the same predicament as mine, can you please suggest me creams that might work?"
5,"So nice product, my skin is combination type (oily n dry), it works magically especially in winter. Gives u Extra softness.."
4,My mom changed from ponds day n night cream  after ages and the result is so good.
5,"I was bit skeptical about this cream as I was not sure this is good for my age group or not. After using this for about a week I can say that this one is great cream for anyone who is 25+. Its very moisturising so if you have oily skin like I do, little is more. I love to mix it with few drops of rose water n massage my face for a min or so."
5,I would like to give five stars. Really amazing work on wrinkles. I am using my third bottle. But apply it on wrinkles before going to sleep. Apply little thicker. You can see the amazing results. Those who are worried about their wrinkles go for it. I got it for 165rs.
1,"This product gives burning sensation, forget removal of wrinkles and ageing signs. I even got red pathes and rashes on face after 3 days of use. M a huge Himalaya fan, but this product is a big NO!!"
5,"I love it! Light texture, light scent, excellent results. Keeps you looking youthful, of course wont do miracles, but will slow aging process and I feel it removed expression lines that were starting to show. Ive been using it for quite a while, almost a year, and its the best product Ive tried of its kind. I can use makeup straight on top of it and its fine."

5,"Of all teas which i have tested and tasted, this tea has been my companion since many decades...  with little bit of adrak, pudina leaves, and one little pinch of the powder of cardamon  sticks - but you add milk separately heating it. And see the difference...It is heavenly after a tiring day ... though am not addicted to tea... but have found this particular tea very much enjoyable... and light :-)Thanks ."
5,"I tried many other tea brands over the years, however, I have to wait for those tea to finish to get back to getting this Tea. There is no match for this tea. Ive been using this since childhood."
5,"Tasted Society Tea Regular Tea first time at my friendss home in Mumbai and found it very good. could not find it locally and hence as soon as I found it on Amazon, placed the maximum no.pouches allowed to an individual buyer."
5,"One of the best tea Ive ever tasted , my family in Mumbai has been using this for ages..Best thing is if Milk is hot then it will take only 2 mins to prepare....The colour, taste and aroma is just mesmerizing.."
5,"Taste is a matter of preference. Personally speaking, quite liked the taste and flavour of the brand"
5,Have been using society since many yearsAlways the same taste and flavour
4,It is good for tea lovers who like their tea strong and straight.
5,OK Product
5,Very tasty tea which we are using for long.
5,Tastes better than other products.delivered on time.planning to buy 1 kg pack...

1,"Earlier"" society ""tea powder is Good in quality and flavour but after ""society ""comes in society its quality degraded and amlagmation of dust in ""chaipatti "" dettered its qiality.we hope for best from ""society ""to best for society"
5,"Im a milk-tea addicted person. Although, I control it upto thrice day but sometimes it may exceed 5.Since I like milk-tea alot, I have tried many Dust-teas available in the market.Ive tried and tasted Wagh-bakri, brookebond, Taj, society, maharsthra chai, maa-beti Chai  you name it.I liked the society tea alot. This tea when boiled in the water gives a nice flavor and the color which no other teas can give.The packaging was nice. I ordered for a 1kg pack directly since I already knew about the taste.From the value for money standpoint, it is a little costlier (20-30 Rs per kg)  in comparison to its other teas of its class. But you will find it worth it. Just make sure you use a correct method to prepare to get the best out of it.Method in the sense, first boil it in water and then add milk.Directly adding into milk will also give you the good taste but the colour will fade away in that case."
1,Received this product in damaged condition and it doesn’t come under returnable category. Since the seal is broken can’t use the product
5,We are A family of tea drinkers and found it to be the best ever had.Been faithful to Tata tea gold since it got launched but had to buy society tea when our brand was not available during lockdown and found it to be better than Tata tea gold.Where Tata tea gold has longer leaf this one looks like any other tea but once the tea is brewed the colour and taste was as strong as Tata tea gold. Not a percent less.Price was also similar to Tata tea gold. Henceforth we are going to buy whichever brand is on discount online.
3,"Tea above rs. 400 per kg should not contain dust..At the rate 400/-, why to add dust with ctc granules.. Its a 100% margin business, still the company providing sub standard ctc instead of bopsm.. I will not going yo buy it again"
4,"Society tea by far is the best brand in terms of taste, colour and flavour. Im using this brand of tea since ages, maybe more than 15 years. Infact I dont buy any other tea except Society. But this time Im not satisfied with my buy as no discounts were offered."
1,Product is fine. Package had a hole in it  tea powder leaked out.
2,Society Masala Tea is far better than this one. Pack within expiry but due to storage conditions discolored.
5,"I am using this tea for last 7 year.  Getting this product in bangalore is not easy. Sometime it will be avaialble. Happy to get this product through Amazon.Tea flavour is too good.  After having Society tea, we are not fine in having any other tea :)To get the proper flavour, boil it in water well then add milk.  Sometime i use this tea decoction for hair conditioning also. So pure."
5,It’s perfect and this 500 gm mini pouch i purchased to gift a friend of mineI had ordered one kg jar in jan and second one has just arrived yesterday...do i need to say more???Perfect taste of Chai ...!

1,"Recently, I visited a relative in Dubai and tasted Society Masala tea for the 1st time.  I simply loved it, more so when I found real ingredients like cinnamon, cardamom, ginger etc. written on the box.  I ordered same tea in india once I got back and I am shocked to see that there are no real ingredients.  The box says there are added flovors only.  How disgusting to find that what is sold in india and exported abroad is totally different.  I wish I could return the tea but unfortunately, Amazon does not accept return of food items."
5,"Excellent product as its smell,taste and flavour... Every customer who have idea about tea take it without dought ...drink with milk or without milk. Thank you my Amazon and thank you seller... I am very satisfied."
5,Very good one. Tastes awesome. But the product has come in a plastic water bottle which is free. The plastic is very cheap and the smell of plastic is there in the tea also. Had to empty the contents to a better container. Earlier the container the tea came was very good. This time they have changed it to a water bottle.
4,The tea is good. But old stock. Packed on October 2016. Best before 12 months of packing. So its already outdated when received.
1,"The tea is great but the delivery charges ruins the whole taste and it feels iy aint orth it. 130 is MRP  120 is Delivery charges which make it double the price, thus not worth it."
5,This masla tea is best in taste and aroma.I purchased four  different  companies  masala tea to compare the taste .l found test of Society masala  over and above three companies  masala tea.Further a small quantity  of  tea leaves  require to prepare  aromic tasty tea.I am continuously  purchasing this tea now.
5,When I made my first brew I got impressed by the smell only. The smell was really nice and above all masala was thoroughly mixed within the tea leaves which release its taste and aroma when water boils. Delivery was fine and instead of box I got a very beautiful sipper which made my day.
1,The which has been sent looks like its a fake product as there are lumps in it ... plus there a foul smell coming out of it please take it back and refund my money
3,Good but very spicy. Young people will like it but for old/children it is very strong.If mixed with normal tea then better.
3,Good for the first time use. Later you get irritated due to the spices. May be they should have added more cardamom

1,The which has been sent looks like its a fake product as there are lumps in it ... plus there a foul smell coming out of it please take it back and refund my money
3,Good but very spicy. Young people will like it but for old/children it is very strong.If mixed with normal tea then better.
3,Good for the first time use. Later you get irritated due to the spices. May be they should have added more cardamom
1,"Recently, I visited a relative in Dubai and tasted Society Masala tea for the 1st time.  I simply loved it, more so when I found real ingredients like cinnamon, cardamom, ginger etc. written on the box.  I ordered same tea in india once I got back and I am shocked to see that there are no real ingredients.  The box says there are added flovors only.  How disgusting to find that what is sold in india and exported abroad is totally different.  I wish I could return the tea but unfortunately, Amazon does not accept return of food items."
5,"Excellent product as its smell,taste and flavour... Every customer who have idea about tea take it without dought ...drink with milk or without milk. Thank you my Amazon and thank you seller... I am very satisfied."
5,Very good one. Tastes awesome. But the product has come in a plastic water bottle which is free. The plastic is very cheap and the smell of plastic is there in the tea also. Had to empty the contents to a better container. Earlier the container the tea came was very good. This time they have changed it to a water bottle.
4,The tea is good. But old stock. Packed on October 2016. Best before 12 months of packing. So its already outdated when received.
1,"The tea is great but the delivery charges ruins the whole taste and it feels iy aint orth it. 130 is MRP  120 is Delivery charges which make it double the price, thus not worth it."

5,"When you need just one cup of tea and are too lazy to go through the whole rigmarole, this product is a lifesaver!Just heat water (optionally, add some milk for a richer taste) in a cup in the microwave, then drop in a heaped scoop of this premix. Voila, your tea is ready - no utensils to wash, no gas needed, no tea leaves to throw and no tea filter to clean.Decent in taste, full marks for convenience, this is a must-have in my kitchen."
3,There are ten sachets in the pack along with measuring cup for 100ml water. You can make one cup tea per sachet. Taste is individuals preference. But I found tea made from Girnars sachets more tasty.
5,This is perfect for travellers and lazy people only thing u need to do is take hot water mix powder and awesome masala tea is ready(make sure u follow instructions and mix it in right proportion as instructed).Its a must if u are travelling and u cant live without good tea.
1,"I didnt like the taste of it. Too sweet and while I do like sweets, not in my tea. I bought it because I couldnt get my regular one and that this was from Society, and yet I discarded it after just trying it once. So you can imagine how much I hated it. But to each his own. You might like it, who knows. As for me I am never ordering it again."
1,Nothing special.  Need to mix in a lot of the powder to get a decent tasting cup of tea.
5,This instant tea is really good. The only thing you need to do is add 1 tsp of milk powder to 1 scoop of tea along with 100 ml hot water. Tastes great and is super refreshing! A must buy!
5,My favorite premixed Masala Tea... I only wish the policy of limited quantities of this product per customer is removed.
5,Tried many premixed massala tea earlier.. didnt like them.. This time orded it with doubts.. but really amazed with the product..  Its really my choice of massala tea...
5,We are regularly using this tea..Best option for early morning busy routines..Just pour hot or warm water and your tea is ready..Purchased several times now..

4,"The flavour and aroma are amazing but simply mixing water gives a very thin consistency. I mix a spoon of milk powder to get the thickness of milk so that it feels like real tea. Its also cheaper, even for a wholesale pack, compared to other companies."
1,waste of moneyi dont like i think is old stock
1,The packet was torn... Strange flavour. Not like the original.
4,I THINK THIS PRODUCT IS NOT ORIGINAL.FLAVOUR WAS SO DIFFRENT.
5,"Nice product. However, would like an option of Lemon Grass flavour also, at the same price."

2,The original society tea the blue packet is better than this. It has one salty taste that make the tea horrible. No premium quality. Price has increased with deteriorated quality
4,"The tea is really good. Tastes better than wagh bakri premium tea but grain size is much smaller.Leaves a lot of dust at the bottom of the container which is a bit annoying. Every time you finish the container, a lot of tea will be wasted in the form of dust."
4,We are drinking this tea since years when we are in Mumbai.Only recently started to purchase it on amazon as it isnt available in any stores across Hyderabad.But in few packets the tea is very tiny n does not taste as strong as it should be.
3,"As the pricing was highest for this product in the company range assumed that it would be the best color and flavor.However was disspointed as the flavor is similar to the cheaper leaf tea or even some good dust variety. Also the tea leaves had some foul chemical odour coming, usually teas leaves give a fine frangance.This was prepared with full milk and not black. Not buying this again for sure."
5,Great taste. Bought it for my parents as they prefer mild teas and it is great for both mild and strong teas. We add a bit more leaves to make it strong. Most teas in Kerala have a flowery taste and they are not good for masala chai. This purchase solved that issue. Its great as a black tea as well. Just dont boil it while making black tea. Boil the leaves only for masala chai.
3,"Good strong flavour, low price. But falsely advertised as ""premium Leaf"". It is very granular, almost like coffee grounds.Grains smaller than standard CTC, something like Dust Tea."
5,"Very good taste. Feel the rich aroma. Very refreshing. After tasting several brands, found this tea with the premium flavor I was looking for. I will buy only this Society Premium tea moving forward."
5,The flavous is awesome and packs a punch. Its on the stronger side of the spectrum so those who prefer a lighter flavour should look for something else. The delivery was fast and reacher here a good condition.
5,Excellent tea very very strong tea previous i used taj mahal tea thats a very very worst product love you society Premium tea

3,Im a new mom and trust me every second is important to me. Society one minute tea saves a lot of my time. I dont have to wait for tea to boil or anything. Just a cup of hot water and a tea bag is all I need.
5,Excellent dilute out of premix tried till time. Good test perfect no difference found compare to daily tea prepared with tea milk sugar and masala
5,"This one-minute tea is perfect for all hardcore tea lovers. It may not be as good as a thorough-boiled tea in your house but it is way, way better than those futile tea bags that add no taste to the hot water. Perfect for office use or while you travel, it shall surely make you feel home, wherever you are. :)"
5,"I love the taste of this flavour.. Easy to make, hope they bring larger packs with 100 sachets or something."
2,"We were disappointed in the quality of the product. Society is known for strong tea. However, after having the Girnar premix teas, this one was mild and had very little flavour or smell of cardamom."
3,"very light tea. At similar prices, very good flavoured tea is available. got it wrong bcoz of the brand name"

5,"It is strong and tastes very good. After trying almost 10 different brands of tea, I have found the one I like. I have tried Taj Mahal, Red label, RCM and many different others.I like my tea strong and for that you dont have to add too much of this tea. It is not just too strong tea, it tastes good. Most in my family like it and this is the one we are going to use from now on along with Red Label for those who like Red Label more.And Amazon, from time to time, provides good discounts on products and makes them affordable for all. Btw, it sells for 355 next door mall when Amazon is selling it for 385. I know shipping costs, so it is ok."
4,"We in our family have switched from Red Label to Tata Tea Gold now.Red Label is not bad, its just this one is better.This tea is perfect blend of aroma, taste and strong nature of tea. This is perfectly balanced tea between taste and kadak chai.Wagh bakri Tea is too strong with awful taste and Red Label is not so strong but taste good.This one got balanced both of it. So a must buy."
3,"Received d product safe n intact But first time I received the very OLD dated products tea powder 7.5 month older and Ketchup is also 7.5 month older...:(Ketchup is to be used within 1.5 month... that to 1kg I have ordered.. :(sir, before this order I purchased Tata Tea Powder two months ago that product was received with Mfg. date 03/2017...!!! but now I received 2016 Mfg productsLoosing faith on Grocery Order...:("
1,The quality of the item is not up to the mark. The flavor and the strong test that we (me  my family) found in local shops of ₹10 pack of this tea is missing here.This item is fully useless in case of making liquor tea(red tea). If less liquor is given the tea seems nothing but boiled water  if given more the tea becomes black. I got stuck with this 500gm tea.
3,I have been using this product for more than three years but I always purchased 500 gm and 250 gm pack but this is the first time that I have purchased 1 kg pack with the expectation that the quality would be same but alas! this 1 kg pack has too much dust tea and very less leaf tea compared to 500 gm or 250 gm pack.Regarding price it is competitive than market price and regarding delivery I would give amazon one star.
5,Got it on deal arnd @190 rs.
4,"Reviewing CTC tea can be tricky: everyone has their own preferences. Flavour profiles that one has become accustomed to often determines how one reacts to a new tea.For the purpose of making milk tea,  this particular brand is quite good: a strong combination of good colour, definitely pleasing fragrance and taste thats firm but not too overpowering.This is a good option for someone used to tee leaves made by the likes of Wagh Bakri. This has slightly more liquor to it than the Wagh Bakhri and the fragrance spectrum is a bit wider.If youre the type who likes your Tata Agni and similar robust and bolder tea leaves then this may not be what youre looking for.Its price point is on the higher side and may be a factor for many. That said,  if you enjoy that one good cup a day,  its a worthy buy-in.My recommendation: certainly worth a try especially if you like a good,  developed flavour in your cuppa."
1,Its hard to believe how much they have gone down on the quality aspect compared to what it was 5 years back.

So fellows go for it blindly give it a try and i am really sure with this decision you wont regret it.Ps :  if you guys like very strong tea then go for tata premium this one is little mild, use elaichi, ginger and honey mix it well it adds up the flavour to your tea. I hope this review help you to choose right tea for yourself."

5,"I was using Red label since ages and some time back switched to Tata Gold tea for some reason.I must say Tata gold is way cheaper and tests much batter than Red Label.Also quantity required to make a cup of tea is lesser compared to Red Label.These are my reasons to switch to Tata Gold:  1. Because of the controversial advertising by Red Label where they said that people go to Kumbh Mela to abandon  their old age parents. Thse MNCs come to India, make money from us and than mock us, this should not be tolerated.  2. To support Indian Brands like Tata, Patanjali, Dabur, etc."

5,"One of the best tea from the house of Tata and it is is a beautiful tea having good taste and flavour... actually it is an appropriate mixture of CTC and leaf tea..I ordered this product from Amazon and it was delivered on the next day in a very good packaging... I got it at discounted price...I got the product at 15% discounted price, as I bought the product during Super Value Days.The manufacturing date of product was just 2 and half months ago from date when I received the product in hand. Hence it is recently manufactured product. Also the product have a very good shelf life.Amazon delivered the product in very good condition and packaging of the product was just awesome. No damage. Amazing...The Amazon pantry box are very hard and during packaging they insert air filled sealed packets, so that the items dont move and pressure is absorbed by the air filled packets.Delivery of my order was just the next day morning. The delivery man took the package inside of my house, as it was heavy and kept the pantry box over a table, as I told him. I behavior of the delivery man was good.I am highly satisfied with the product and I recommend you to buy the product without any fear and hesitation. Believe me you will be satisfied after receiving the product and using it."
1,"This tea surprisingly has no taste and flavour, aroma at all. Total waste of money. With 2 spoons for a cup of tea there is no taste at all it feels like we are having just hot water with sugar. It needs 3 spoons for a cup, to atleast get slight taste of tea. I took 500gm pack now its getting difficult to even finish the pack and start with some new tea. I took this tea because my regular brand Wagh Bakri was not available. Such tasteless tea is really not expected from brand Tata."
1,"Looks Like Duplicate, When buy from Near by Grocery Shop, the taste is different.Delivered in Amazon pantry packets taste is very inferior, no aroma and color."
1,"Nothing like Gold. It tastes really unexpected, not worth the price. Dont know what is the hype about.I purchased this Tea pack with GREAT EXPECTATIONS but was disappointed because even when I added two full spoons of tea leaves didnt really got that aroma and taste and not even color.Assuming by the reviews I am reading, It could be a fake product that I received.Will surely try to purchase again and give my valuable feedback."
5,I think its one of the best available tea in this segment in the market... After all its a TATA product... It has long leaves...Please note that you have to use more quantity as compared to regular tea... I recommend making tea in a closed container on slow/low flame for best results...
5,"This tata tea gold is a real gem in the house from tata. In my house we are using this tea since many long long years. And everyone like it. So fellows go for it blindly give it a try and i am really sure with this decision you wont regret it.Ps :  if you guys like very strong tea then go for tata premium this one is little mild, use elaichi, ginger and honey mix it well it adds up the flavour to your tea. I hope this review help you to choose right tea for yourself."

5,"If you really a teas fan, you definitely not being unaware of the TATA Tea family. Trusted brand from so many years. I tried almost every standard brand of Teas available in the market, but at last I can say that TATA Tea is the best available brand in the printed price. Although TATA Tea brand is already quite efficient in serving the purpose but the current addition of TATA Tea Gold actually makes sense because of the quality enhancement by adding dried whole tea leaves in to the processed tea. Mixing of whole leaf resulted into the enhanced flavor  color of the prepared Tea. Not more concentrated not milder, it’s like a balanced golden color with real taste/flavor which designed exactly keeping in mind the expectation of the user.1. I agree that if you require strong color/flavor you need to add a little more leaves in to the preparation because TATA Tea Gold is not meant for people who like very strong color seekers. Its more workable for people who wants real flavor with natural golden color in the final preparation. Although even a single tea-spoon is enough to prepare a natural golden cup full of real tea.2. One may keep in mind before using that this tea contains real whole dry tea leaves, so it may take more 2 minutes in preparation in comparison with other brands and the reason is, it is without any added artificial colors into it. The whole dried tea leaves takes time to release real flavor of the contents.3. Taste is premium  up to the expectations as always.4. Packaging is good enough. Visual ergonomic principles well taken into consideration designing the same. Its smarter and visually appealing than the previous packs.I’m using this product from more than 2 years. So, its not an random review. In my family we are using this product in making of every single cup day and night 24x7, whenver we feel like to have one."
5,"I prefer Tata tea to Brooke Bond/Taj Mahal.# Mild taste and fresh aroma# Gives me a soothing effect and relishes# Only small quantity sufficient for making tea# Does not play around with the basic tea taste# Can be consumed with milk or without itThe only issue is with the packaging, I would have preferred plastic box packaging for the price.That would actually help in preserving the aroma and prevent moisture.But, its one of the best tea for everyday use.Cheers :)"
4,Flavour of this tea is goodIt includes little leafs you can see them in itMust try tea
5,"For those who love tea this is a great blend.1. It is a mix of  assam tea and leaf tea - gets you the best of both.2. To enjoy the blend and the tea it should be put in boiling water ( do not boil it post putting tea)3. Let it simmer for some time  3-5 min , and add sugar and milk separately .4. It works out great for the tea lovers and offers a consistent blend all the time.Once you start liking this tea - you will get hooked to it...."

5,"After using Taj Mahal tea for 20 years, now since the quality of Taj Mahal tea has gone down tremendously, and we have gas and stomach problems after consuming taj mahal tea, we wanted to shift for a better tea. After finding out a lot about different brands, I can assure you This is best tea in India. Always buy this.The taste is awesome, the only drawback is you have to put a lot of tea if youre used to drinking strong tea. Otherwise this is awesome."
1,"Once you see the packing and presentation of the package, one gets positive vibes and expects a lot more than regular tea. ALAS! It is much the same as Agni. Nothing more. Have to use good quantity to prepare good tea."
4,"I am using Tata tea Premium regulary, but bought Tata tea gold just to give it a try to see if its more strong in flavour/aroma or tastes something different. However could not feel much difference rather it is more or less same like Premium tea infact Premium is better.."
5,I have been taking Tata Gold tea since over two decades now. I have tried many cheap and expensive products but Tata Gold is non-replaceable. The new golden color packing is attractive.

5,There is no other equivalent brand available in the market. Have been using for 5 years on 2 occasions in a year for friends and relatives and they are happy.
5,I already tasted this tea from the local store and tastes really good so I bought a large pack from online. The packaging was good and received on time without any damage.
4,The taste is good and one will enjoy. The name GOLD is only superlative. Actual taste is just above average. Tata Tea Gold fails in giving rich brown colour to tea. Hence it does not meet 100% expectation.
5,Amazing flavour... Was searching in all the shops during this covid period but I could not find any one in the market so decided to buy in Amazon and was so happy
3,Ive been using Tata Tea Gold since very long time so no doubt about flavour or aroma. But little disappointed with the design of the packet. There is no zip lock like in 1kg pkt. You have to store in air tight container else you will lose the aroma. I bought in lightning deal for Rs. 490.
1,BEWARE BEFORE BUYING ITS JUST ABOUT TO EXPIRE IVE RECEIVED IT ON 26JULY
1,"Duplicate and fake item in the name of original Tata tea tastelessI really doubt of this quality, it may be duplicate because whenever buy from retailers then got taste and when ordered online at discounted prices, very poor taste u cant imagine likeNaa khata h na metha h na namkeen h like a very poor quality and I really doubt on this it may be completely fake or duplicate item in the name of original"
5,"I bought it for taking it abroad because my wife wanted it. Unfortunately, the trip has been postponed because of COVID-19. So I cannot comment on taste yet, though I found that 1 Kg packet costs about Rs. 440, and 250 g packet costs about Rs. 120."
4,My family likes the taste. This is the monthly savings pack. I brought 499/1.5 kg in some deal going on.
3,"i Tried wagh bakri, red label, tata agni, vedaka gold tea, etc.. but this time i tried tata tea gold but it turns out to be an average tea.. if i compare this tea with wagh bakri and vedaka gold it doesnt give good colour and 1.5 times more tata tea gold required to get same color as of wagh bakri and vedaka gold.. so if you want good color strong tea use vedaka gold or wagh bakri because these tea gives good color compared to tata tea gold"

1,The tea packet was torn . I would like this order replaced
1,I always purchase Tata Agni Leaf tea. Could observe the quality and taste difference a lot this time. Quality not up to the mark. There is much difference between the previous and current tata agni tea purchase. Going forward not going to buy this tea. Waste of money. Not sure if other buyers observed the same.
5,"Tata Tea Agni is good but the quality of this tea have changed a lot previously there was some leaves but nowadays Tata Tea Agni contains only powder tea or dust tea, it gives good liquor but not so much flavour.If you want good liquor along with flavour then you must go for Tata Gold tea that is a good tea. I bought Tata Tea Agni from Amazon at a very low price compared to the MRP and the packaging of the product was really awesome and it was delivered to my home address Durgapur Rana Pratap Road West Bengal within 5 days of ordering.If you want to buy good quality tea with good flavour then you should buy Tata Gold tea, Taj Mahal tea or Darjeeling tea."
5,"Simply put, the tea is flavourful  of good quality for a very cheap price compared to others in the market  also I got the 1kg pack for rs.170 which was manufactured recently. I got 3 packs  all 3 was delivered in great condition."
5,"Good package, it tastes good but  quantity less when compared to red label, but the aroma is nice.... Over all satisfied with the taste...."
3,Tata Agni Tea is value for money. Its MRP is 220/- . Overall good for buy. I recommend to buy this product. Go for cheaper tea.
5,"₹ 200Its a truly good deal for you !Market price per 100 gram is around ₹ 25-30 , but heres ₹ 20 only.Flavor is extremely good and quite strong.It comes specially for milk-tea.If you ask about the packaging quality, I say Amazon very much disappointed me for the first time, they parceled it via a single poly bag, no cardboard box provided which is not expected from Amazon.Luckily I have received my package 100 % good conditions !"
1,"Expected better quality tea from a brand like Tata tea. Very low quality tea. Didnt like its flavour and taste. Maybe the tea was very old, expired quality. Its disappointing. Tea quality was not upto Tata tea standard."
5,Tata Tea Agni is good if youre looking for good less priced option of tea. This tea is not too strong youve to add some large qty to make tea strong. But looking at its price its best. The price is 200/kg which is the lowest in the market. Im using this for last 5 months. Recommended
1,Packed is damaged if no replacement what we need to do pls confirm. Dont buy.  Dont buy dont buy dont buy

5,"Tata Tea Agni is good but the quality of this tea have changed a lot previously there was some leaves but nowadays Tata Tea Agni contains only powder tea or dust tea, it gives good liquor but not so much flavour.If you want good liquor along with flavour then you must go for Tata Gold tea that is a good tea. I bought Tata Tea Agni from Amazon at a very low price compared to the MRP and the packaging of the product was really awesome and it was delivered to my home address Durgapur Rana Pratap Road West Bengal within 5 days of ordering.If you want to buy good quality tea with good flavour then you should buy Tata Gold tea, Taj Mahal tea or Darjeeling tea."
5,"Simply put, the tea is flavourful  of good quality for a very cheap price compared to others in the market  also I got the 1kg pack for rs.170 which was manufactured recently. I got 3 packs  all 3 was delivered in great condition."
5,"Good package, it tastes good but  quantity less when compared to red label, but the aroma is nice.... Over all satisfied with the taste...."
3,Tata Agni Tea is value for money. Its MRP is 220/- . Overall good for buy. I recommend to buy this product. Go for cheaper tea.
5,"₹ 200Its a truly good deal for you !Market price per 100 gram is around ₹ 25-30 , but heres ₹ 20 only.Flavor is extremely good and quite strong.It comes specially for milk-tea.If you ask about the packaging quality, I say Amazon very much disappointed me for the first time, they parceled it via a single poly bag, no cardboard box provided which is not expected from Amazon.Luckily I have received my package 100 % good conditions !"
1,"Expected better quality tea from a brand like Tata tea. Very low quality tea. Didnt like its flavour and taste. Maybe the tea was very old, expired quality. Its disappointing. Tea quality was not upto Tata tea standard."
5,Tata Tea Agni is good if youre looking for good less priced option of tea. This tea is not too strong youve to add some large qty to make tea strong. But looking at its price its best. The price is 200/kg which is the lowest in the market. Im using this for last 5 months. Recommended
1,Packed is damaged if no replacement what we need to do pls confirm. Dont buy.  Dont buy dont buy dont buy
5,The product was delivered on time. Its definitely worth the price. Using this for the past 3 months and I have no complaints. Quality of the product is exceptional. Its a bit heavy and no negatives apart from that...
5,I am writing review after 15 days use.Big dial as expected with great quality. Color of dial not too dark specially numbers as shown in photo. Bracelet is also very good. But the packing and container of watch is worst that i have ever seen in online shopping. sometime it stops working when it falls.By pushing the pin it starts working again.overall it is a very good watch. waterproofing  is also working properly.I bought it after 2 month search on amazon and flipkart and it makes worth.
3,Watch seems original but the price paid is equal to showroom price and if u add courier charge is over and above the selling price in showroom. Better buy from showroom rather online since u will get ur product immediately and can able to check the condition there itself. Rest about product is good but the steel quality is Matt finish and not that great to hold. Dial is awesome and lil big in size to give rich look.
5,"Excellent quality and looking cool when I wear this, the white dial is awesome and I like it more. Orange needles for time indication gives good look to watch."

5,"I gifted this to my friend on her birthday, she is very happy with the product.."
5,Such a nice watch at this price.... Wonderful..... Happy with the purchase
4,Good. She liked!
5,Amazing watch. People who have thin wrist like me can definitely go for it without a second thought. Dial is in medium size. So it is very good for thin wrist as a big dial could cover the complete upper portion of your wrist. Baby pink colour is mild just as shown in the picture. Amazing watch for affordable price. Good for daily use. Worth the money.
5,"toooooo lovely cute amazing choooooo chweeeeet very pretty, i got this at 1020rs after amazon pay cash back discount"
2,"Product was good for small wrist girls ,I have big wrist ,but the dail color is not good after seeing this product I think I ordered brown color dail in the same model,I give this watch to my sister ,I dont like this watch,any one want to buy u go for brown color , although your favorite color is pink also ...trust me brown will be good compare to pink I saw my friend wearing same watch in brown color that is really good compare to pink"
4,I loved it. The style finish everything. The dial though is slightly smaller to what I expected it to be. But at this price you should just enjoy its grace. Totally worth it. The Can pack is cool but would request a more sturdy case. Wanted to add a pic but have packed it for gifting purpose.
5,Very good product
5,"I loveď it.. ..  seriously . .I mean  while selecting i was 70% sure but when I got it for my gf. I was 100%, after a long time my gf said that u made a good choice . She got happy n seeing her happy I myself became happy. Thankzz Amazon for having such quality products. ."

5,Sexy  smart watch with many new features
2,"Small display, gray display, only notification, cant read sms or what app, music controller missing."
5,"It is perfect. Good condition although the plastic box was cracked. The watch is original, works fine."
1,Charging unit is not received to me in the package.?How could I charge the band?
2,"The display is very big it was not expected.Also functionality wise we have very few options. Also the display is horizontal and perpendicular to the hand which is difficult to view. By the way a I didnt used it for more time time, I returned it on the same day when I received. So I have no comments on on other portions. But I noticed that the steps tracker updates lately. It is not a step by step update, it is updating in its own time intervals which was not expected in this conventional wristbands of todays market."
4,"I got a genuine product with a good packaging and safely handled.I have been using this band since 1 month. I didn’t face any issue with it’s battery life and performance. It has functionalities like distance, heart rate, Calorie, steps tracker Which are accurate and in time too. It displays only call And Whatsapp’s texts notifications ( I have connected my band to iphone so I have no idea if it performs differently when connected to Android smartphones). The battery life is almost 5 days if fully charged once! Sensors inside the watch work finely. This band helps to find the phone if lost. It tracks the sleep time as well which will be displayed on a phone. Hope this was helpful For you."
5,Im Using Almost 2 months Nearly its Working Good and Style is Simply Nuce
2,The product stopped after one day of usage. But since it was a gift and I had bought it early the replacement period ran out. So I am now stuck with a non working smart watch which cannot be fixed anywhere locally. Any insight on what to do now will be really appreciated.
5,"I have been using the product for past 15 days. here is my honest review of the product.Pros :1.Looks best for lean hands, stylish wrist band and is unisex.2.OLED screen looks awesome.3. Heartrate sensor4.Indian and Tata productCons:1.Can not silence or mute incoming calls."
5,This watch is just awesome. Its battery life is long lasting and all the additional features makes it worth buying and it looks so fashionable as well.

1,1. sleep mode not operating2. battery life not more than 1 day
5,Good product  as it is my second smart watch this is better than my previous one...
4,"I like this band giving almost accurate Heart rate will very Good battery life. Good AMOLED top with decent look ,Broad daylight reading may be improved  if audio can be integrated will give more exciting feel factor"
3,"Pros -Looks goodIndian brandConsThe software is poor.The band and app get updated everyday for bug fixes, but the update never completes.Sleep tracker doesnt work properly - no auto sensor, it depends on manual time feeding for sleep, plus sleep data changes of band firmware update causes sudden change in connection.Call notification does not work. It worked for a couple of calls, but then stopped on its own.Though the sedentary reminder was switched off, the band keeps vibrating every 15 minutes for reminding, even while walking or doing work. It stops only in night mode or when active workout is on."
1,The heart rate monitor shows as OFF on the tracker whereas visible in the phone.The same value should be visible in the tracker as well as shown in the picture
1,"I have an order, step tracking was not working and in replacement I received an used watch which was not even packed."
1,"Ordered 2 of these and Got 2 defective pieces.Frequent impairing from mobile, discrepancy in sleep / movement tracking and horrible interface.Just bought this product for my parents because they wanted a made in India product but guess what, this product is made in China too! Great work Fastrack (Titan)!Would have given it Zero Stars if I possibly could."
2,"I had my hopes high but today when I worked out for 45 minutes and the fitband showed that I had lost only 10calories, I decided to return it.... May be this device is only for step counts, and I work out more than walking.... Not good...."
1,Product stop working after 15 days no display no charging nothing working very bad experience earlier one I got from Titan shop it last for kore than 2 years pathetic performance for me
4,Good watch. Bought it at reasonable price in sale.

5,I have to thank the amazon recommendation engine for suggesting the mysore sandal talc. I never knew mysore sandal brand had a talc! I had purchased mysore sandal soap few weeks back and perhaps due to this purchase amazon would have recommended this as well. Glad I clicked the suggestion and bought one of these! Its good bye to my existing Ponds Sandalwood talc !This review compares Mysore sandal talc vis-a-vis Ponds Sandalwood talcPros-1. The Fragrance is the first thing which hits you as soon as you open the bottle. Its smells pure authentic sandal wood than the perfumed ponds talc powder2. The mysore sandal talc allows you to decide the size of the hole you want to have on the bottle. Ponds one forces you to have 3 holes as soon as you want the top cover. I always hated this with the ponds talc. Ponds really wants you to use more than what you need!3. The fragrance last longer than the ponds sandalwood talc even though out the day! Believe it or not - you have to try one and be the judge!4. Some reviews talk about the powder not been finely powdered. Nothing like that - the powder is as fine as its with Ponds sandalwood talc. No more no less!5. The bottle is sealed with a hologram sticker - thats assurance of genuine product from mysore sandal!6. Somehow I like the press-fit top of the bottle to keep the fragrance intact in the bottle when not in use! Ponds bottle was a twist to close top which is not really a seal tight way of shutting close the bottle7. Last but not the least- mysore sandal talc is 50% cheaper than Ponds sandalwood - why on earth would I ever buy Ponds again?Cons-None that i spotted yet
5,Mysore Sandal is best talc ever in market.. Long-lasting fragrance increase body charm. And I can its Pure natural sandalwood talc. also its very economic talc but no compromise in quality. Go on.....
4,"First time buy, the Talc is okay as its from Mysore Sandal, but still not sure about the scent, longevity and essence of it.Also minimum buy of 2, is not fair  also there wasnt any discount even at the sale time :-( ;-)Well, Amazon, Cloudtail India  Mysore Sandal have done good job, and I believe it will be genuine product!"
5,Just amazing fragrance....original product Delicately perfumed with pure natural sandalwood oil....thanks Amazon for giving me natural product ...Mysore sandal talc is the best talc forever..
1,"Texture is not good, should be finer. Not so cheap either, you can get Nivea 400 gms at same price.Quality also not good, not soft on my skin. Fragrance also not good, guess not a fan of sandalwood after all."
1,be careful. the image is misleading. it looks like it is offering 3 diff sizes of talcum powder whereas the seller gives only one (large size). if you are expecting to receive all the 3 diff sizes of talcum powder then you are in for a big shock. I think the seller must take note and provide correct product image.
1,"I had ordered 2 of these which arrived on Dec 28 2019. However on opening the seals I noticed an unusual detergent like smell and had no smell like sandalwood oil.  It seems either a fraudulent product has been inserted into the container at the source or maybe this was done by some unethical third party. Wanted to return the items, but being a toiletry product, there is no such option. Very unhappy with the purchase"
5,"It has terrific scent. Its not a pinkish or yellowish colour its white colour but we can feel it long n last.I think package Design is changed but Im sure about it, its genuine product.Highly recommended go with this if ur choice is sandal.Because its good brand with half of price than other ponds n santoor."
4,"Nice product, being a govt made product, the quality and genuineness are there.  No stains left in skin after use, whereas Ponds and some other sandal wood powders leave stucky white stain marks. Fragrance is also long lasting."
5,The best product .. So pure.. Must buy

5,"I bought this on a lark and it had been sitting on a shelf for a very long time. Till I developed warts on my chin. No amount of pulling and scrubbing helped and I was reluctant to use over-the-counter wart paint because of all the pharma warnings on them.I decided to use this clay on the warts, covering them with a generous coat of the clay twice a day and kept it on day and night for a month. Voila!I had to be patient but a month of application fixed my skin. Whatever this face pack contains, it is extremely effective. I used to a feel a constant sting after application but it can be ignored. The best part is that it didnt affect healthy skin adversely unlike wart paints which require precautions.Caution - These warts werent because of an STD. I probably picked them up at the gym or some other place with too many people milling around in sweat. Please seek your doctors advice if you have an STD. This face pack should not be applied on your eyelids or where you have a chance of ingesting it. Read disclaimers on the package."

1,I stay in Bangalore snd used this product on couple of occassion. Its amazing and stands well above any available soap in marketLooking at tje expwrience decided to gift ghe soap to a relative and the product that was delivered was a fake and just a lump of cake with so smell and offcourse no way close to the original soapRelative was shy enough to admit his / her experience late other wise could hav returned the productHppe Amazon takes some action
1,It’s the worst thing you can buy. Do not waste your money. You will land up to a soap which will lead to dry skin after bath and you won’t feel like using it again.  Only using name like millennium soap doesn’t make it a soap of millennium. Buy products like nutregena or forest essential rather then buying this particular soap.
1,Dont think this is original.The golden seal on inside plastic box seems to have been tampered with and resealed with plastic tape.
1,The product is not original.. I just used one I got from store in Bangalore and this is no way close to the original product. The soap is soft and breaks in flakes... the original is not like this .. please dont buy would be my honest opinion.  Rest up to you.
5,i always buy this soap cause it smells like strong sandal wood. when i was first introduced to the soap it was a guy coming out of the shower and i stopped him asking which parfum he uses and he pointed me to the soap. at first i couldnt believe it but now after so many years using it there is no doubt anymore.
3,"Something is wrong with this product currently, Ive been using it since 3 years nd have loved it but the latest batches delivered to me seem fake. The quality has deteriorated and now the scent goes on decreasing with each time you use the soap. Towards the end it feels/smells like just an ordinary soap. Disappointed.. i miss the pure, older millennium soap"
5,Awesome just need to work with the soap dish its a pathetic design water stays in and then the soap gets stuck to itApart of their weirdly pathetic innovation of cheap soap dishThe soap is awesome and amazingClass apart
1,broght the original from mysore sandal factory outlet once. very good scent that last for the day long. but this one seal tampered and scent not lasting for an hour.no return policy also.do not buy from amazon.
4,Awesome long lasting fragrance. You would not need bathroom freshener if you start using this soap. Comes in very very fancy packaging. They couldve made the packaging normal and reduced the price a bit.
1,Today l received package in good condition but when l open i found first soap packet in opening condition and there is no soap only soap case
1,I stay in Bangalore snd used this product on couple of occassion. Its amazing and stands well above any available soap in marketLooking at tje expwrience decided to gift ghe soap to a relative and the product that was delivered was a fake and just a lump of cake with so smell and offcourse no way close to the original soapRelative was shy enough to admit his / her experience late other wise could hav returned the productHppe Amazon takes some action
1,It’s the worst thing you can buy. Do not waste your money. You will land up to a soap which will lead to dry skin after bath and you won’t feel like using it again.  Only using name like millennium soap doesn’t make it a soap of millennium. Buy products like nutregena or forest essential rather then buying this particular soap.

1,"This mysore sandal agarbatti we have been using for many years now. This set of agarbattis though smelling good from outside when the packet arrived, when it is fired, it is not giving the fragrance and quite faded a fragrance. It looks like it is an infringed product . Very disappointed . Previously it used to be so fragrant that the whole house used to filled up with its smell but now not at all"
